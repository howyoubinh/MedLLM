    "augmented_question": "Here's a rewritten version of the text using synonyms for medical terms:\n\nA 35-year-old man visits his healthcare provider due to itchy, watery eyes that have persisted for the past week. He has also been experiencing multiple episodes of facial irritation and runny nose on a daily basis during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency related to chronic blood loss, as well as enthesitis related arthritis (ERA). Current treatments include iron supplements, artificial eye drops, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination reveals bilateral conjunctival redness with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm in diameter, equal, and responsive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye shows no abnormalities.\n\nNote: I replaced the medical terms as follows:\n\n- Anemia -> Iron deficiency (note that this term is more specific)\n- Conjunctivitis -> Conjunctival injection\n- Artificial tear drops -> Artificial eye drops\n- Indomethacin -> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs)",
    "options": {
      "A": "Erythromycin ointment",

  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. Ketotifen eye drops. Ketotifen is an antihistamine that can be used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. The patient's symptoms, including itchy, watery eyes, facial irritation, and runny nose, are consistent with allergic conjunctivitis. The fact that he has a history of similar symptoms during the spring season further supports this diagnosis. Ketotifen eye drops can help alleviate his symptoms. Erythromycin ointment (Option A) is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis. Warm compresses (Option C) can be used to treat some types of conjunctivitis, but they are not the first-line treatment for allergic conjunctivitis. Fluorometholone eye drops (Option D) are a type of steroid and are not indicated for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.</s><s>"
