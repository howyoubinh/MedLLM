He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg.

He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and degenerative joint disease of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and ibuprofen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and beta blockers after the cardiac procedure. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg.

  "model_response": "Renal papillary necrosis is a well-known complication of sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, and analgesic abuse. The vasoocclusive crisis in sickle cell disease is caused by the blockage of the small vessels by the rigid, sickled cells. The sluggish blood flow in the necrotic areas may lead to bacterial infection, which can further aggravate the symptoms. The other choices are not related to sickle cell disease.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
