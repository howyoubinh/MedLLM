    "question": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has hypertension and asthma. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His pulse is 114/min and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased serum troponin T concentration. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?",
    "augmented_question": "Here is the rewritten text with medical terms replaced with synonyms:\n\nA 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has elevated blood pressure and respiratory issues. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and sweaty. His heart rate is 114 beats per minute and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An electrocardiogram shows T-wave depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased level of cardiac enzyme creatine kinase in the blood. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?\n\nHere are the replaced medical terms with their synonyms:\n\n1. Hypertension -> Elevated blood pressure\n2. Asthma -> Respiratory issues\n3. ST-segment depressions -> T-wave depressions (note: ST-segments and T-waves are related but distinct electrocardiogram phenomena)\n4. Serum troponin T concentration -> Level of cardiac enzyme creatine kinase in the blood\n5. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was not replaced, as it is a specific term used to describe a particular value, rather than a synonym for a broader concept.\n\nPlease note that while these replaced terms maintain the same meaning, they may not be exact synonyms or have identical connotations.",

  "model_response": "The patient has a history of hypertension, asthma, and acute coronary syndrome. He has an LVEF of 58%, which is below the normal range of 55-70%. The patient should be placed on a medication regimen that includes antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel (option C) to prevent further thrombotic events. Aspirin (option A) is also recommended for long-term use in patients with cardiovascular disease. Beta-blockers (such as metoprolol or atenolol) are recommended for patients with a history of myocardial infarction and heart failure. However, beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with asthma, so beta-blockers should not be added to this patient's medication regimen. Anticoagulants (such as enoxaparin, option B) are used in specific situations, such as after stent placement or in patients with atrial fibrillation. Spironolactone (option D) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that may be used in patients with heart failure. Nifedipine (option A) is a calcium channel blocker that is used primarily for the treatment of hypertension and angina.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
