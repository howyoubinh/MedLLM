    "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",
    "augmented_question": "Here's a rewritten version of the text with medical terms replaced with synonyms:\n\nA junior musculoskeletal surgery resident is completing a median nerve compression release with the department chief as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts an extensor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor deviation from protocol that will not compromise the patient's outcome, as he does not want to distress the patient unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this deviation out of the operative note.\n\nHere are the replaced terms:\n\n* Orthopaedic surgery -> Musculoskeletal surgery\n* Carpal tunnel repair -> Median nerve compression release (this term refers to a surgical procedure to relieve pressure on the median nerve in the wrist)\n* Flexor tendon -> Extensor tendon\n* Complication -> Deviation from protocol or minor deviation\n* Operative report -> Operative note\n\nNote: I replaced \"operative report\" with \"operative note\", as it is more commonly used term in medical writing.",

  "model_response": "The junior resident should not leave this deviation from protocol out of the operative note. It is important to document all events that occur during a surgical procedure, even if the outcome was successful. The patient has the right to know about any errors that occurred during the procedure, and it is part of the resident's professional responsibility to ensure that the patient is informed. The resident should discuss the situation with the attending and the attending should not pressure the resident to leave this out of the note. The attending should support the resident's decision to disclose the mistake.</s><s>"
