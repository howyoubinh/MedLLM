    "augmented_question": "Here's a rewritten version of the text with medical terms replaced with synonyms:\n\nA 39-year-old man presents to the acute care facility because of progressively worsening thoracic discomfort and queasiness that started at a local establishment 30 minutes prior. The pain radiates to the upper abdominal region. He has a 5-year history of unmanaged high blood pressure. He has been smoking one packet of tobacco products daily for the past 5 years and recently developed an addiction to cocaine two weeks before his visit to the hospital. The patient is sweating profusely and in extreme distress. What should be the initial step in management?\n\nNote: I replaced the medical terms as follows:\n\n- \"chest pain\" with \"thoracic discomfort\"\n- \"epigastric area\" with \"upper abdominal region\"\n- \"hypertension\" with \"high blood pressure\"\n- \"cigarettes\" with \"tobacco products\"\n\nPlease note that while these synonyms are used to provide a different interpretation of the text, they should not be used in actual medical contexts without proper understanding and expertise.",

  "model_response": "The initial step in management should be to administer 'Reassurance and continuous monitoring'. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a possible myocardial infarction. The reassurance will help alleviate the patient's anxiety, and continuous monitoring will allow for the timely detection of any cardiac events. The administration of medications such as 'Diltiazem', 'Labetalol', 'Propranolol', and 'Nitroglycerin' should be based on the patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings.</s><s>"
