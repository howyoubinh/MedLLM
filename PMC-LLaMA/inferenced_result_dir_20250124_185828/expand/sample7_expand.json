    "question": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has hypertension and asthma. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His pulse is 114/min and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased serum troponin T concentration. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?",

  "model_response": "The patient should receive a 3-month course of clopidogrel after stent placement. The other listed drugs are not indicated. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that could worsen coronary vasospasm. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that has been used in acute coronary syndromes to prevent restenosis, but is not recommended for routine use after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that could exacerbate electrolyte imbalances. Warfarin is not indicated for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
