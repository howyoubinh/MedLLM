  "model_response": "The resident should dictate the operative report as usual, including the tendon injury. The resident should not be a party to covering up a mistake. The resident should not feel that he or she is responsible for the injury, but it should be included in the record. The resident should not be deterred from dictating the true and complete story of the case. The resident should not be concerned about harming the patient by disclosing the error, because the patient has a right to know about all aspects of his or her care. The resident should not feel that he or she is responsible for the injury, but should include it in the record. The resident should not be concerned about the patient's inability to pay, as this is not a valid reason to cover up an error.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
