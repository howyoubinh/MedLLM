    "question": "Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin count 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 16,400/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 56%\nEosinophils 11%\nLymphocytes 31%\nMonocytes 2%\nPlatelet count 260,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 25 mg/dL\nCreatinine 4.2 mg/dL\nRenal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\"",

      "A": "Renal papillary necrosis",

  "model_response": "The patient has cholesterol embolization syndrome. Atheroembolic disease occurs from disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque, with subsequent embolization to the renal and visceral arteries. Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with acute kidney injury, livedo reticularis, or confusion. The reticular mottling often involves the lower extremities and is paicularly prominent in the pretibial region. Renal biopsy shows characteristic \"cholesterol crystals\" within the lumina of vessels. The other choices are not related to the findings in this case.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
