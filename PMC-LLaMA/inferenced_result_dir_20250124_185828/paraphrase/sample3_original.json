    "question": "A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 126/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line. Pelvic examination shows mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness. Laboratory studies show:\nPlatelet count 14,200/mm3\nFibrinogen 83 mg/mL (N = 200–430 mg/dL)\nD-dimer 965 ng/mL (N < 500 ng/mL)\nWhen phenol is applied to a sample of the patient's blood at 90°C, a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is identified. A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following?\"",
    "augmented_question": null,
    "options": {
      "A": "Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci forming mauve-colored colonies on methicillin-containing agar",
      "B": "Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar",
      "C": "Spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli forming yellow colonies on casein agar",
      "D": "Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar"
    },
    "augmentation_type": "none"

  "model_response": "The patient has a serious infection of the pelvis, probably an acute pelvic inflammatory disease. The low platelet count and fibrinogen, along with an elevated D-dimer, indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation. This is a common feature of septic shock, which also explains the hypotension. The dimer with fatty acids attached indicates that this is a leukocyturia. The organism is likely to be a gram-negative rod, since it does not produce mauve colonies on methicillin-containing agar. It is lactose-negative, since lactose fermenters would have formed pink colonies on MacConkey agar. The organism is likely to be encapsulated, since encapsulated organisms can be identified with India ink. The organism is likely to be spore forming, since spore formers can be identified as grey colonies on charcoal blood agar. Coagulase-positive cocci forming mauve colonies on methicillin-containing agar are likely to be Staphylococcus species.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
