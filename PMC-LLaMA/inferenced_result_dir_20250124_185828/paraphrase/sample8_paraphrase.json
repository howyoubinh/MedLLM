    "question": "A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?",
    "augmented_question": "Here's a paraphrased version of the original text:\n\nA 37-year-old woman visits her primary care physician to explore alternative birth control methods, seeking to discontinue oral contraceptive pills after an eight-year regimen. Her vital signs are stable, with normal blood pressure and heart rate. She also undergoes a routine physical examination with no abnormalities noted. The question is which past medical history would preclude the insertion of a copper intrauterine device in this patient.\n\nNote: I've kept the same meaning as the original text but rephrased it to convey the information in a different way, while maintaining clarity and concision.",
    "options": {
      "A": "A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism",
      "B": "Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)",
      "C": "Past medical history of breast cancer",
      "D": "Known liver neoplasm"
    },
    "augmentation_type": "paraphrase"
  },
  "model_response": "Option A: A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism would not preclude the use of a copper intrauterine device. However, it would require a more thorough evaluation to determine the safety of the device.\n\nOption B: Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) would preclude the use of a copper intrauterine device. PID is an infection of the female reproductive organs, and the presence of an intrauterine device can increase the risk of infection.\n\nOption C: Past medical history of breast cancer would not preclude the use of a copper intrauterine device. However, it would be important to ensure that there are no current breast masses or other signs of recurrence before proceeding with the device.\n\nOption D: Known liver neoplasm would not preclude the use of a copper intrauterine device. However, it would be important to ensure that there are no other liver pathologies or concerns before proceeding with the device.\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
