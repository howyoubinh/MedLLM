    "question": "A 68-year-old male comes to the physician for evaluation of right flank pain. He has a history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease. His blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness and right flank tenderness. An ultrasound shows dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",
    "augmented_question": null,
    "options": {
      "A": "Renal artery stenosis",
      "B": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia",
      "C": "Common iliac artery aneurysm",
      "D": "Urethral stricture"
    },
    "augmentation_type": "none"
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a classic presentation of renal colic due to ureteral obstruction. The most common cause of ureteral obstruction in an older man is a stone. The stone passed and the pain resolved. The patient now has a more chronic problem, probably a stricture from repeated episodes of obstruction from stones or sloughing of a papilla. The patient's underlying vascular disease is probably unrelated. Renal artery stenosis is more common in women and younger patients, and the presentation is usually with accelerated hypertension. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is common in older men, but does not usually cause flank pain. Common iliac artery aneurysm is unlikely because it would have been seen on the ultrasound. Urethral stricture is also a possibility, but is less likely because it would also have been seen on the ultrasound.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
