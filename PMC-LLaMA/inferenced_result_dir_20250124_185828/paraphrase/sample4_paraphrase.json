    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",
    "augmented_question": "A 35-year-old elementary school teacher presents with a recurring seasonal complaint, characterized by itchy, watery eyes and frequent sneezing over the past week. This episode mirrors one he experienced exactly one year ago during similar times of the year. The patient has underlying medical conditions, including anemia caused by iron deficiency and inflammation-related spondylitis. His current treatments include supplements to address his nutritional needs, artificial tear drops to soothe his eyes, and pain relief medication. Despite these remedies, the symptoms persist. A thorough physical examination reveals redness in both eyes, accompanied by a watery discharge, normal vision, and responsive pupils that light up with stimulation. The condition affecting his eyes appears to be related to allergies, as indicated by its recurrence around specific times of the year. Given this information, the most suitable treatment option should address this seasonal allergy issue.",
    "options": {
      "A": "Erythromycin ointment",
      "B": "Ketotifen eye drops",
      "C": "Warm compresses",
      "D": "Fluorometholone eye drops"
    },
    "augmentation_type": "paraphrase"
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. Ketotifen eye drops. Ketotifen is an antihistamine that reduces the release of histamine from mast cells. It is applied topically as eye drops and is effective in treating allergic conjunctivitis. Erythromycin ointment (A) is used to treat bacterial infections of the eye. Warm compresses (C) can be soothing, but will not address the underlying allergy. Fluorometholone eye drops (D) are corticosteroids that reduce inflammation, but should be avoided in cases of allergic conjunctivitis, as they can exacerbate the condition over time.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
