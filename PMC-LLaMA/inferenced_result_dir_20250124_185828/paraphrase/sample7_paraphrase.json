    "question": "A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has hypertension and asthma. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His pulse is 114/min and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased serum troponin T concentration. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?",
    "augmented_question": "A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain that has been ongoing for 30 minutes. With a history of hypertension and asthma, he is currently taking atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears flushed and clammy, indicating tachycardia (heart rate 114/min) and possibly hypovolemia, as evidenced by low blood pressure (130/88 mm Hg). His electrocardiogram reveals indicative signs of acute heart attack: ST-segment depressions in key areas of the heart. Blood tests also show elevated levels of troponin T, a marker for heart damage. The patient receives treatment for an acute coronary syndrome and undergoes a minimally invasive procedure to widen blocked arteries (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). After being discharged, his left ventricle's efficiency is found to be 58% as measured by echocardiography. In addition to aspirin, what medication should be added to this patient's treatment plan?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nifedipine",
      "B": "Enoxaparin",
      "C": "Clopidogrel",
      "D": "Spironolactone"
    },
    "augmentation_type": "paraphrase"

  "model_response": "The patient should be placed on a medication that inhibits platelet aggregation, such as clopidogrel. This drug is often used in conjunction with aspirin to prevent the formation of blood clots that can lead to heart attacks. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is used to treat high blood pressure and angina, but it does not inhibit platelet aggregation. Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin that is used to prevent blood clots in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is used to treat hypertension and heart failure.\n\n### ADDITIONAL EDGE:\n\nThe ejection fraction (EF) is a measure of the left ventricle's efficiency. An EF of 58% means that the left ventricle is pumping out 58% of its blood volume with each contraction. Normal EF ranges from 55% to 75%. An EF of 58% indicates that the left ventricle is moderately enlarged and may be damaged from a previous heart attack. Medications that can improve the EF include those that reduce the load on the heart, such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
