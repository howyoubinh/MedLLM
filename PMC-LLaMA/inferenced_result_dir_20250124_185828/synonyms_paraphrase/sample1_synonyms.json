    "question": "A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?",
    "augmented_question": "A 67-year-old man with a type of bladder cancer has sought medical attention due to an unusual sensation in his ear that started two days ago. He had recently received treatment for this condition a week prior, which was intended to help shrink the tumor before surgery. The test results show that he is experiencing hearing problems, specifically difficulty perceiving sounds at lower volumes. Given the side effects of the medication used for this patient's cancer treatment, it is likely that his symptoms are caused by how the drug affects the inner ear.\n\nI replaced the medical terms as follows:\n\n- Transitional cell carcinoma -> Type of bladder cancer\n- Bladder -> Cancer type\n- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy -> Treatment intended to shrink the tumor before surgery",

  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. The patient's symptoms are consistent with sensorineural hearing loss, which is often caused by damage to the inner ear or the auditory nerve. The medication used to treat this patient's cancer likely caused damage to the microtubules in his inner ear, leading to his symptoms. The other choices are not typically associated with hearing loss.</s><s>"
