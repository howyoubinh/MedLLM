    "question": "A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressively worsening chest pain and nausea that started at a local bar 30 minutes prior. The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years and started abusing cocaine 2 weeks before his emergency room visit. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress. What should be the first step in management?",

    "options": {
      "A": "Diltiazem",
      "B": "Labetalol",
      "C": "Propranolol",

  "model_response": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The initial treatment of ACS includes administration of aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine. Aspirin decreases the incidence of death or recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with established myocardial infarction or unsngina. Nitroglycerin may be given in the absence of hypotension to relieve chest pain and may also reduce the incidence of recurrent angina. Morphine is given in an attempt to relieve pain and anxiety and may also have a beneficial effect on coronary blood flow. Beta-blockers are contraindicated in the setting of acute coronary syndrome presenting with ST-segment elevation on the ECG (as in this case) because they may cause cardiac arrest in the presence of an acute coronary artery occlusion.\n\nDiltiazem and labetalol are both antihypertensive agents that may be used in the treatment of hypertension. However, in the setting of acute coronary syndrome, the hypertension should be treated with nitroglycerin and morphine, as these agents will also help relieve chest pain. Reassurance and continuous monitoring are not appropriate treatments for this patient's presentation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>"
