    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable.

    "augmented_question": "Here's a rewritten version of the text using synonyms for medical terms while maintaining the same meaning:\n\nA 35-year-old male presents to his healthcare provider due to persistent, itchy eyes accompanied by excessive tearing that has persisted for the past week. He has also been experiencing frequent episodes of nasal congestion daily during this period. Notably, he experienced a similar episode one year ago around springtime. Due to poor iron levels, he suffers from iron deficiency and chronic degenerative joint disease affecting his spine. Currently, he takes an iron supplement, artificial eye lubricants, and over-the-counter pain relievers as prescribed by his doctor. As an elementary school teacher, he leads a busy lifestyle. His vital signs are within normal ranges. The patient's visual acuity is 20/20 without corrective lenses. A thorough physical examination reveals bilateral inflammation of the membrane covering his eyes, characterized by excessive tearing. The pupils constrict in response to light and measure 3 mm in diameter.\n\nNote that I replaced terms such as \"spondylosis\" with \"chronic degenerative joint disease affecting the spine\", which is a more common medical term for arthritis affecting the spine.",

  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are indicative of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, likely due to pollen. Given his history of allergies and the season, this is a likely diagnosis. The treatment for allergic conjunctivitis includes antihistamines, decongestants, and eye drops. Since the patient is experiencing nasal congestion, an antihistamine such as loratadine would be beneficial. Ketotifen eye drops, which reduce the allergic response, would also be appropriate. Warm compresses can provide some relief for the patient. Erythromycin ointment is typically used to treat bacterial infections of the eye, which is not the likely diagnosis here. Fluorometholone eye drops are corticosteroids that are typically used for short-term treatment of inflammatory conditions of the eye. Given the patient's history of iron deficiency, it would be important to consider iron supplementation. However, this is not the primary treatment for his current condition. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is Ketotifen eye drops, warm compresses, and loratadine.</s><s>"
