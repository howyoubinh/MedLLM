    "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of nausea for the last two weeks. During this period, she has had increased urinary frequency and fatigue. She also reports two episodes of non-bloody vomiting. There is no personal history of serious illness. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. Physical examination shows bilateral breast tenderness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Which of the following is the most accurate predictor of the gestational age?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ratio of head to abdominal circumference",
      "B": "Femoral length",
      "C": "Crown-rump length",
      "D": "Biparietal length"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ratio of head circumference to abdominal circumference is the most accurate predictor of the gestational age. This ratio is 1.3 or greater in the 5th month of gestation, 1.0 from the 6th through 9th months, and 0.6 or less in the 10th month. The femoral length is measured from the top of the femur to the upper border of the symphysis pubis. This length is approximately 2/5 of the crown-rump length at the 10th week of gestation. The biparietal diameter is measured by measuring the distance between the two parietal eminences. This diameter is approximately 1/3 of the head circumference. The crown-rump length is the most accurate predictor of the gestational age during the first trimester.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
