    "question": "A 32-year-old pregnant woman presents to her physician with flu-like symptoms for the past 3 days. She has a runny nose, mild headache, and feels achy. She has a mild fever and diffuse rash over her body. She is concerned about the health of her baby and wants to know if there are any medications that will make her feel better in a short time. Currently, she is at her 29th week of gestation and has received the tetanus vaccination as part of the antenatal care program she received since she immigrated at the end of her first trimester from Romania. She is otherwise healthy. Considering this patient, she is at a higher risk of giving birth to a newborn who will present with which of the following options?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Single S2",
      "B": "Wide pulse pressure",
      "C": "Brachial-femoral delay",
      "D": "Tricuspid valve regurgitation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is D. This patient is most likely experiencing symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). This is an infection caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, which is transmitted through the bite of infected ticks. The tick bite is usually painless and goes unnoticed. The symptoms of RMSF include fever, headache, myalgias, and a characteristic rash that begins on the wrists and ankles and spreads to the palms and soles. The rash of RMSF is usually a maculopapular rash that can be difficult to see in dark-skinned individuals. The most severe complication of RMSF is severe pulmonary edema. The diagnosis of RMSF is clinical, and treatment should not be delayed while awaiting confirmatory serology. Treatment is with tetracycline or chloramphenicol. This patient is at risk for delivering a newborn with a ductal-dependent congenital heart defect, specifically a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is more common in infants born to mothers with RMSF. The exact mechanism for this is not known. The other choices are not complications of RMSF.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
