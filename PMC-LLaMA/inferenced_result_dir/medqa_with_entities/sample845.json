    "question": "An investigator is studying traumatic knee joint injuries in college athletes. Images and tissue samples are collected from 4 athletes with cartilaginous injury and 4 athletes with bone fractures. After 8 weeks, the athletes with bone fractures show almost complete resolution, while the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Transplant of which of the following tissues would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Perichondrium",
      "B": "Proteoglycans",
      "C": "Osteoblasts",
      "D": "Mature chondrocytes"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The perichondrium is a connective tissue that covers cartilage in many locations in the body. It contains a population of progenitor cells that can differentiate into chondrocytes, and it is important for the repair of small cartilage defects. Mature chondrocytes are present in the matrix of cartilage, but they are not able to migrate and repopulate damaged cartilage. Osteoblasts are associated with bone, not cartilage. Proteoglycans are a major component of cartilage matrix, but they are not associated with a progenitor cell population.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
