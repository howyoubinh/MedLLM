    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents to the physician because of incomplete healing of a chest wound. He recently had a triple coronary artery bypass graft 3 weeks ago. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 25 years. Clinical examination shows the presence of wound dehiscence in the lower 3rd of the sternal region. The wound surface shows the presence of dead necrotic tissue with pus. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Surgical debridement",
      "B": "Negative pressure wound management",
      "C": "Sternal wiring",
      "D": "Sternal fixation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has an infected wound with sternal wound dehiscence. The presence of pus and fluid collection is an indication for surgical debridement. The debridement will remove the dead tissue, reduce the bacterial load, and promote wound healing. Negative pressure wound management can also be used to promote wound healing, but it does not address the need for surgical debridement. Sternal fixation is not indicated as it does not address the infected wound. Sternal wiring is also not indicated as it does not address the infected wound.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
