    "question": "A 16-year-old boy with a seizure disorder and cognitive delay is brought to the physician because of progressively worsening right lower extremity weakness for the past 6 months. He does not make eye contact and sits very close to his mother. Physical examination shows a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex. Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows several multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally. A photograph of his skin findings is shown. This patient's condition is most likely due to a mutation in which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "NF1 gene on chromosome 17",
      "B": "NF2 gene on chromosome 22",
      "C": "TSC1 gene on chromosome 9",
      "D": "VHL gene on chromosome 3"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The image shows multiple cafe au lait spots, which are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The NF1 gene encodes for the protein neurofibromin, which has homology to the GTPase Ras. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a multisystem disorder that includes neurologic, ophthalmologic, dermatologic, and skeletal complications. The most common neoplasm associated with NF1 is the optic nerve glioma. The most common cutaneous manifestation is the cafe au lait spot. Other cutaneous findings include axillary freckling and Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas). The most common skeletal abnormality is scoliosis. The most common cardiovascular abnormality is an asymptomatic murmur, as seen in this patient. Renal anomalies include both benign (hydronephrosis, horseshoe kidney) and malignant (Wilms tumor) lesions. NF1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The mutation is located on the long arm of chromosome 17. The other genes listed are associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC1 and TSC2), von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
