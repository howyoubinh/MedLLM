    "question": "A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago. His only medication is metformin. His serum glucose is 186 mg/dL and his hemoglobin A1c is 7.6%. The physician prescribes an additional antidiabetic drug and counsels the patient on its delayed onset of action. At a follow-up appointment 4 weeks later, the patient reports that his home blood glucose readings have improved. He also mentions that he has had a weight gain of 4 kg (8.8 lb). The patient has most likely been treated with which of the following drugs?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Empagliflozin",
      "B": "Liraglutide",
      "C": "Rosiglitazone",
      "D": "Glyburide"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and was prescribed an additional antidiabetic drug. The weight gain is likely due to the anabolic effects of insulin. Empagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor that causes weight gain due to loss of glucose and fluid in the urine. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 agonist that can cause weight loss. Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that can cause weight gain. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea that can cause weight gain.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
