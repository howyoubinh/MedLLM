    "question": "A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after an episode of altered mental status. She was at a party when she suddenly fell to the floor. Her friends state that she was not responsive and was acting oddly. After the episode, the patient seemed confused and had no memory of the event. The patient has a past medical history of substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 117/69 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a girl who seems confused and responds to questions slowly. Her gait is stable, and she demonstrates 5/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities. Laboratory values and a urine dipstick test are performed as seen below:\n\nToxicology:\nBenzodiazepines: Positive\nMarijuana: Positive\nCocaine: Negative\nPhencyclidine: Negative\n\nUrine Dipstick:\nAppearance: Dark\nRed blood cells: Positive\nGlucose: Negative\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?",

      "A": "Diazepam",
      "B": "IV fluids and mannitol",
      "C": "Phenytoin",
      "D": "Supportive therapy and observation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's altered mental status and positive toxicology screen indicate that her symptoms are likely due to drug use. The presence of red blood cells in her urine suggests rhabdomyolysis, a known complication of high-dose drug use. The best next step in management is supportive therapy and observation. The patient should be monitored for any evidence of renal failure or anoxic brain injury. The patient should also be evaluated for any other complications of drug abuse, such as human immunodeficiency virus or infective endocarditis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
