    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician by his parents for evaluation of frequent bed wetting during the night. A detailed history reveals that there has been no history of urinary incontinence during the day since the boy was 4 years of age, but that he has never been dry at night continuously for 1 week. There is no history of urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy. On physical examination, the boy’s vital signs are stable. His neurologic and abdominal examinations are completely normal. His laboratory investigations are as follows:\nUrine-specific gravity (first-morning sample) 1.035\nUrine red blood cells Absent\nUrine pus cells Absent\nUrine culture Negative\nWhich of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine",
      "B": "Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm",
      "C": "Treatment with oral oxybutynin",
      "D": "Treatment with oral imipramine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s history and laboratory results are most consistent with primary nocturnal enuresis, which is defined as the repeated and involuntary voiding of urine during sleep beyond the age of 5 years. Primary nocturnal enuresis is a common problem, affecting 7% of 5-year-old children and 3% of 10-year-old children. The evaluation of a child with primary nocturnal enuresis includes a thorough history and physical examination. The history should focus on the duration and frequency of the enuresis, the presence of nocturnal incontinence, and the presence of daytime symptoms. The physical examination should include an assessment of the neurologic and genitourinary systems. Laboratory studies are generally unnecessary, but a urinalysis and urine culture are indicated if the history suggests a urinary tract infection. An MRI of the spine is indicated if there are signs of spinal cord abnormalities, such as leg weakness or foot deformities. The use of an enuresis alarm is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Enuresis alarms are available in a variety of styles; the most popular are those that sound a tone when a small quantity of urine is detected on a sensing pad. The success of this form of therapy is enhanced when the child is motivated to remain dry and when the parents provide positive reinforcement for the child’s efforts. The use of oral medications (oxybutynin or imipramine) is controversial. Although these medications can be effective in some cases, they are generally not recommended as first-line therapy because of their potential side effects and the limited duration of their effect.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
