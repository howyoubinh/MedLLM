    "question": "A 48-year-old female presents with an enlargement of her anterior neck which made swallowing very difficult for 2 weeks now. She has had constipation for the past 6 weeks and overall fatigue. She also had heavy menstrual bleeding; and often feels extremely cold at home. On the other hand, she has well-controlled asthma and spring allergies. On examination, the thyroid is stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged. There is also pain associated with swallowing. Laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 μg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L. A radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake. Which of the following is the most likely pathology to be found in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Anaplastic carcinoma",
      "B": "Medullary carcinoma",
      "C": "Reidel thyroiditis",
      "D": "Silent thyroiditis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s presentation is most consistent with Reidel thyroiditis. This is an uncommon inflammatory condition of the thyroid that is characterized by extensive fibrosis. The fibrosis can extend beyond the thyroid gland and involve the extrathyroidal soft tissues of the neck. The fibrosis can also entrap and destroy the thyroid parenchyma, leading to hypothyroidism. The thyroid enlargement is usually asymmetric and can extend laterally to involve the carotid arteries. The firm or hard consistency of the thyroid can make it difficult to swallow. The thyroid is also tender. The thyroid parenchyma is typically cold in silent thyroiditis, but this condition is usually associated with a normal TSH and free T4. Anaplastic carcinoma is a highly aggressive malignancy that usually presents with a painless, rapidly enlarging mass. Medullary carcinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor that presents with symptoms related to the secretion of calcitonin. Silent thyroiditis is characterized by thyroid pain and a slightly enlarged thyroid that is usually not tender.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
