    "question": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from his bicycle. The boy was racing with his cousin when he lost control and fell onto his right side. He has nausea and severe pain in the right shoulder. He is in acute distress. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Examination shows swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle and pain exacerbated by movement; range of motion is limited. The skin over the clavicle is intact. The radial pulse in the right arm is intact. Sensory examination of the right upper limb shows no abnormalities. An x‑ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Perform tension banding",
      "B": "Apply a simple shoulder sling",
      "C": "Obtain an MRI of the right shoulder",
      "D": "Perform arteriography"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Perform tension banding. The x-ray shows a displaced fracture of the right clavicle. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform tension banding. This procedure involves drilling a hole through the clavicle and passing a wire under the clavicle to be tightened in the region of the fracture. This maneuver reduces the fracture and helps to maintain reduction. A sling is not adequate to maintain reduction. An MRI is not necessary to make the diagnosis of a clavicle fracture. Arteriography is not indicated because the pulse is intact.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
