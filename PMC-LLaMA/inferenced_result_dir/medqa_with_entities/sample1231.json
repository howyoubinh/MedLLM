He is curious if patients with diabetes (defined as fasting serum glucose â‰¥126 mg/dL on two separate readings) are at increased risk of developing open-angle glaucoma over time. Which of the following is the best statement of the null hypothesis for this study?",

      "A": "The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes",
      "B": "Having diabetes will not cause changes in risk of future open-angle glaucoma",
