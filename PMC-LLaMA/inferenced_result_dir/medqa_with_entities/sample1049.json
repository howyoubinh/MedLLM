    "question": "An investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B. Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for the described findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Conjugation",
      "B": "Reassortment",
      "C": "Transformation",
      "D": "Recombination"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The described findings are consistent with the process of transformation, in which DNA is transferred from a donor to a recipient bacterium. The infectious isolate of H. influenzae is likely to have acquired genes that confer virulence through transformation. The noninfectious isolate, when mixed with lysed infectious isolate, may have acquired the virulence genes through transformation. When the noninfectious isolate is introduced into animals, some of them develop symptoms of infection.\n\nConjugation is the process by which DNA is transferred from a donor to a recipient bacterium through a sex pilus. This process is not described in the given scenario.\n\nReassortment is the process by which segments of DNA from two different viruses are exchanged during a mixed infection. This process is not described in the given scenario.\n\nRecombination is the process by which genetic material from two different sources is combined. This process is not described in the given scenario.\n\nTransposition is the process by which segments of DNA move from one location to another. This process is not described in the given scenario.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
