    "question": "A 78-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. CT demonstrates a mass in the head of the pancreas, and biopsy is planned for the following day. The patient's daughter approaches you outside the room to request that the results of the biopsy not be shared with the patient. She asks that the results instead be shared with her and her brother, who is the patient's documented health care proxy. She explains that she and her brother have discussed the situation and decided that it is best to not inform the patient that she has cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy the next morning confirms the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the best response to the patient's daughter's request?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ask the patient's son, the documented health care proxy, how he would like to handle the situation",
      "B": "Inquire why the patient's daughter feels her mother should not be informed of the diagnosis",
      "C": "Offer to explain the diagnosis to the patient without using the word \"cancer\"",
