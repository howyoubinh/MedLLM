    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is referred by her dentist for a suspected eating disorder. She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her ‘skinny friends’. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed",
      "B": "Patients do not usually initiate treatment",
      "C": "Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia",
      "D": "Patients will typically have a BMI between 17–18.5 kg/m2"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient in question is showing features of bulimia nervosa. This disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of uncontrollable excessive eating (binge eating) followed by compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting or excessive exercise. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least twice a week for 3 months. Self-induced vomiting is the most common compensatory behavior. Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed. Patients do not usually initiate treatment. Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia. Patients will typically have a BMI between 17–18.5 kg/m2.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
