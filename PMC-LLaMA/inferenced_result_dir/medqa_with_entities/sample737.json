    "question": "A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with dyspnea and palpitations. He does not smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol, and past medical history is insignificant. Blood pressure is 115/75 mmHG and heart rate is 125/min. Heart rhythm is irregularly irregular. After initial treatment with IV digoxin the patient's heart rate drops to 85/min and remains irregular. Which of the following best explains the effect of digoxin in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors",
      "B": "Calcium channel blockade",
      "C": "Vagal stimulation",
      "D": "Increased ventricular contractility"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Digoxin increases vagal tone and decreases sympathetic tone, both of which slow AV conduction. The vagal effect is more prominent, reducing heart rate. The slowing of AV conduction is responsible for the therapeutic effect in atrial fibrillation, as well as the toxicity (including the induction of ventricular arrhythmias). Digoxin does not have any significant effect on ventricular contractility.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
