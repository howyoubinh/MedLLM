    "question": "A 75-year-old man becomes pulseless in the cardiac intensive care unit 48 hours after admission for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. His blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows a tachycardic irregular rhythm with erratic undulations, but no discernible P waves or QRS complexes. During immediate advanced cardiac life support, two attempts at defibrillation are made, after which the patient is given 1 mg of IV epinephrine. After another attempt at defibrillation, the patient remains pulseless and his blood pressure is 60/35 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows no changes. Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amiodarone",
      "B": "Epinephrine",
      "C": "Dopamine",
      "D": "Atropine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is in ventricular fibrillation, as demonstrated by the irregular undulations of the baseline ECG (which are absent in ventricular fibrillation). The initial management of ventricular fibrillation is immediate defibrillation. If defibrillation is unsuccessful, immediate cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are indicated. Amiodarone is the antiarrhythmic agent of choice for ventricular fibrillation. Epinephrine is used in the management of asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Dopamine is used to maintain blood pressure in patients with shock. Atropine is used in the management of asystole or pulseless electrical activity.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
