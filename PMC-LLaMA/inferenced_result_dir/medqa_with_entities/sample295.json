    "question": "A 32-year-old female complains to her gynecologist that she has had irregular periods for several years. She has severe facial acne and dense black hairs on her upper lip, beneath her hairline anterior to her ears, and the back of her neck. Ultrasound reveals bilateral enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts. Which of the following is the patient most likely increased risk of developing?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Endometrial carcinoma",
      "B": "Addison disease",
      "C": "Wegener granulomatosus",

    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has the signs of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by amenorrhea, obesity, hirsutism, and enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts. The increased conversion of androgens to estrogen in the ovarian cysts leads to endometrial hyperplasia and an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma. Addison disease is not associated with PCOS. PCOS is associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to glucose intolerance. PCOS is not associated with Wegener granulomatosis or eclampsia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
