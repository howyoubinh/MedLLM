    "question": "A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with difficulty breathing and a sensation that her heart was racing for the past 3 days. She adds that she has lost weight over the last 7 weeks, despite a good appetite, and is anxious most of the time with difficulty sleeping at night. She has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 15 years. Her blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), and pulse is irregular with a rate of 140–150/min. On physical examination she is thin, frail, and appears anxious. Her palms are sweaty and there are fine tremors on extension of both hands. She has a palpable smooth thyroid mass. Examination of the eyes reveals bilateral exophthalmos. An electrocardiogram is obtained and shown in the picture. Which of the following has a strong positive correlation with this patient’s heart rhythm?",

  "model_response": "This electrocardiogram shows a rapid, irregularly irregular rhythm. The QRS complexes are narrow, suggesting a ventricular origin of the arrhythmia. There are no clearly discernible P waves, but the irregularity of the QRS complexes suggests an irregular ventricular response. The QRS axis and intervals are normal. The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The irregularity of the rhythm suggests a lack of AV synchrony.  The absence of clearly discernible P waves on the electrocardiogram makes it difficult to know whether the patient has underlying heart disease. The patient's symptoms, however, suggest that she has a hyperthyroid state. Thyrotoxicosis is a cause of atrial fibrillation and may be associated with exophthalmos and a palpable thyroid mass. The irregularly irregular rhythm suggests that the patient is having episodes of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The absence of AV synchrony increases the risk of cardiac failure. The patient's age, sex, and smoking history make her a candidate for coronary artery disease. The absence of chest pain and the electrocardiogram findings make acute myocardial infarction unlikely. The patient's symptoms, however, suggest that she has a hyperthyroid state.

The absence of AV synchrony increases the risk of cardiac failure. The patient's age, sex, and smoking history make her a candidate for coronary artery disease.
