    "question": "A 31-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia is brought to the emergency department by police after being found agitated and attempting to steal from a grocery store. His past medical history is only notable for a recent office note from his primary care doctor for treatment of seasonal allergies. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 173/97 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who is very irritable and restless. He is not cooperative with exam or history and becomes combative requiring intramuscular medications and security restraining him. After this event, the rest of his exam is notable for 7 mm pupils which are equal and reactive to light, spontaneous movement of all limbs, normal sensation, and warm and sweaty skin. The patient is answering questions and states he wants to kill himself. Which of the following substances was most likely used by this patient?",

      "B": "Cocaine",
      "C": "Diphenhydramine",

  },
  "model_response": "This patient's symptoms are most consistent with an anticholinergic toxidrome. His agitation, delirium, and autonomic instability are classic features of this toxidrome. The mydriasis is also consistent with this diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes intoxications with atropine, scopolamine, and diphenhydramine. The most likely substance in this case is diphenhydramine due to the recent office note. The other substances listed are not typically associated with these symptoms.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
