    "question": "A 67-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of fatigue and dizziness for the past 2 months. He reports that he gets tired easily compared to his baseline and feels dizzy when he exerts himself (e.g., when he walks long distances). His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is controlled with lisinopril. A physical examination demonstrates moderate hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy. His laboratory studies are shown below.\n\nLeukocyte count and differential:\nLeukocyte count: 11,500/mm^3\nSegmented neutrophils: 40%\nBands: 3%\nEosinophils: 1%\nBasophils: 0%\nLymphocytes: 50%\nMonocytes: 8%\n\nHemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL\nPlatelet count: 120,000/mm^3\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration: 31%\nMean corpuscular volume: 80 Âµm^3\nReticulocyte count: 3%\nLactate dehydrogenase: 45 U/L\n\nA subsequent flow cytometry test demonstrates CD20+ cells. What is the most likely finding you would expect in this patient?",

  "model_response": "The presence of hairy cells is a rare cause of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The presence of CD20+ cells on flow cytometry is consistent with CLL. The other findings in this patient are not consistent with CLL. Low levels of erythropoietin can cause anemia. Low levels of LAP can be seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Smudge cells are seen in CLL.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
