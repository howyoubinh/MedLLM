    "question": "A previously healthy 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of depressed mood and fatigue. During this time, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. She reports trouble concentrating at her job as a preschool teacher and has missed work several times in recent weeks due to generalized fatigue. She has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years and is actively trying to quit smoking. A drug is prescribed that will treat the patient's mood disturbance and support smoking cessation. This patient should be counseled about which of the following possible side effects of this drug?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypotension",
      "B": "Urinary retention",
      "C": "Tachycardia",
      "D": "QTc prolongation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient is likely being treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for a major depressive episode. SSRIs are effective for depression, but they can cause drug-induced hypotension, which is more likely to occur in patients who are also taking other medications that lower blood pressure, such as antihypertensives or vasodilators. The medication should be used cautiously in patients with known heart disease or those at risk for heart disease, because it can cause cardiac conduction delays, which can result in fatal arrhythmias. Urinary retention is a side effect of anticholinergic medications, not SSRIs. Tachycardia is a side effect of some medications used to treat anxiety, not depression. QTc prolongation is a side effect of some medications used to treat psychosis, not depression.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
