    "question": "A 53-year-old man presents to clinic with a six month history of shoulder pain that is especially bothersome at night. Over the weekend he \"strained his shoulder\" during a pick-up basketball game and reports an acute exacerbation of his pain symptoms. On exam, he complains of pain to palpation just below the acromion. You suspect he has torn his supraspinatus. If correct, which of these functional maneuvers would you expect to be deficient on physical exam?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Initiation of adduction",
      "B": "External rotation",
      "C": "Initiation of abduction",
      "D": "Internal rotation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The supraspinatus is responsible for initiating abduction of the arm. Therefore, with a supraspinatus tear, you would expect to see deficient initiation of abduction. The other choices are not functions of the supraspinatus.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
