    "question": "A 23-year-old man presents with sudden loss of consciousness while pitching in a baseball game. There is no history of injury. Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse. There are no audible murmurs. An S4 is present. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "B": "Aortic stenosis",
      "C": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy",
      "D": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's history of sudden loss of consciousness while playing baseball, with the subsequent recovery after cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is suggestive of sudden cardiac death. The presence of a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse, a double apical impulse and an S4 indicates the presence of left ventricular hyperophy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
