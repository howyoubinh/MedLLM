    "question": "A 35-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. The patient is found to have a blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL. Hgb A1c was found to be 5.1%. C-peptide level was found to be decreased. The patient returned to her baseline after glucose replacement. She states that she has never had an episode like this before. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of diabetes in her mother. She states that she has been undergoing a difficult divorce over the past few months. What is the likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Insulinoma",
      "B": "Factitious disorder",
      "C": "Hypothyroidism",
      "D": "Somatization disorder"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's low blood glucose level (35 mg/dL) and low C-peptide level (decreased) indicate that this is a case of hypoglycemia due to exogenous insulin administration. The fact that the patient returned to her baseline after glucose replacement is consistent with the diagnosis of hypoglycemia. The patient's history of a difficult divorce, coupled with her family history of diabetes, may have led her to attempt to lose weight by taking insulin. The low C-peptide level is consistent with exogenous insulin administration because endogenous insulin production would result in an elevated C-peptide level. The patient's low Hgb A1c level is also consistent with her recent insulin use because an elevated Hgb A1c level would indicate long-standing hyperglycemia. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with any of the other choices. Insulinomas are rare and would not be the most likely cause of this patient's condition. Factitious disorder is unlikely because there is no other evidence of a desire to assume the sick role. Hypothyroidism is unlikely because it would not cause hypoglycemia. Somatization disorder is unlikely because there is no other evidence of multiple somatic symptoms.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
