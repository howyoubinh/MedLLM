    "question": "A 26-year-old man comes to the physician for episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and a 6-kg (14.2-lb) weight loss over the past 2 months. He reports that the fever lasts for 7 to 10 days, then subsides completely for about a week before returning again. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral mediastinal masses. Resection of a cervical lymph node is performed. A photomicrograph of the resected specimen is shown. Further histopathological examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30",
      "B": "Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement",
      "C": "Cells overexpressing Bcl-2",
      "D": "Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a classic presentation of Hodgkin lymphoma, with a predominance of large, pale, lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells in a mixed inflammatory background. The Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells, which are usually found in the context of the nodular sclerosis subtype, express CD15 and CD30. The RS cell shown here is large, with a bilobed nucleus and prominent nucleoli. The RS cells are usually found in a reactive background of small lymphocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts. The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, which is associated with follicular lymphoma, and the t(8;14) translocation, which is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, involve the Bcl-2 gene. The BCR-ABL rearrangement is seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Overexpression of Bcl-2 is seen in follicular lymphoma. The t(14;18) translocation is not associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
