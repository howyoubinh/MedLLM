    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head on collision. The patient’s echocardiogram (ECG) is notable only for sinus tachycardia. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. Initial workup demonstrates that the patient’s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins are elevated. The patient is currently complaining of chest pain. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable young man with bruising over his chest wall. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cardiac contusion",
      "B": "Hemorrhage",
      "C": "Pulmonary contusion",
      "D": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of blunt cardiac injury. The most common cause of blunt cardiac injury is myocardial contusion. The patient’s elevated troponins and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggest myocardial dysfunction. The patient’s chest pain is likely due to the myocardial contusion. The patient’s bruising over the chest wall is likely due to hemorrhage into the subcutaneous tissue. The patient’s hypotension is likely due to the myocardial contusion. The patient’s tachycardia is likely due to the pain from the myocardial contusion. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient condition that is associated with emotional stress. The patient’s presentation is not consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient’s presentation is not consistent with pulmonary contusion. Pulmonary contusion is associated with respiratory distress and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient’s presentation is not consistent with hemorrhage. Hemorrhage would be associated with hypotension and tachycardia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
