    "question": "A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration. He says this started abruptly about 6 hours ago. He says that he has not noticed that anything that makes his pain better or worse. He also denies any other symptoms. He works as a long-haul truck driver, and he informs you that he recently returned to the east coast from a trip to Utah. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from when he was a child. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "ECG",
      "B": "V/Q scan",
      "C": "D-dimer",
      "D": "CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient is a D-dimer assay. A normal D-dimer assay has a high negative predictive value and can be used to safely discharge outpatients who are at low risk for pulmonary embolism. A V/Q scan is used to rule out pulmonary embolism in patients with a high clinical pretest probability. A CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast is the gold standard test for ruling in or out pulmonary embolism. An ECG is not a reliable test for ruling out pulmonary embolism.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
