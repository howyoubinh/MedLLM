    "question": "An 18-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her mother for vaginal bleeding. The mother states that she noticed the bleeding today, which appeared as brown discharge with clots in the patient’s diaper. The mother denies frequent nosebleeds or easy bruising. She also denies any known trauma. She does mention that the patient has been limping and complaining of left leg pain since a fall 2 months ago. On physical exam, there are multiple 2-3 cm hyperpigmented patches on the patient’s trunk. There is bilateral enlargement of the breasts but no pubic hair. The vaginal orifice is normal and clear with an intact hymen. A plain radiograph of the left lower leg shows patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis. Which of the following is associated with the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bitemporal hemianopsia",
      "B": "Hypertension",
      "C": "Pheochromocytoma",
      "D": "Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s presentation is consistent with McCune-Albright syndrome. The classic triad includes precocious puberty, cafe-au-lait spots, and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. The fibrous dysplasia can affect many bones, including the femur, which can lead to leg length discrepancy and pain. The bone lesions can also be associated with pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by mutations in the GNAS gene. Bitemporal hemianopsia and hypertension are associated with Cushing syndrome. Pheochromocytoma and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia are associated with von Recklinghausen disease (neurofibromatosis type 1).\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
