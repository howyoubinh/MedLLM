    "question": "A 75-year-old woman is brought by a patrolman to the emergency department because of altered mental status. She was found wandering next to the highway. The patient was unable to answer questions and collapsed in transit. Her vitals are: temperature, 33.0°C (91.4°F); pulse, 40/min; respirations,12/min; blood pressure, 80/50 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation, 85% on room air. Physical examination shows decorticate posturing, incomprehensible speech, eyes opening to pain, dry hair, coarse and waxy skin, and non-pitting edema around the face and all extremities. Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia. Laboratory studies show:\nCalcium 9.0 mg/dL\nHematocrit (female) 34%\nPotassium 4.0 mEq/L\nSodium 120 mEq/L\nTSH 110.0 µU/mL\nThyroxine (T4) 1.2 µg/dL\nTriiodothyronine (T3) 70 ng/dL\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Myxedema coma",
      "B": "Pheochromocytoma crisis",
      "C": "Septic shock",
      "D": "Tertiary hyperparathyroidism"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Myxedema coma is a medical emergency that, without treatment, is almost uniformly fatal. It is a presentation of severe, decompensated hypothyroidism, usually in the elderly. Myxedema coma may be precipitated by factors that impair respiration, such as drugs (especially sedatives, anesthetics, and opioids), pneumonia, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, or cerebrovascular accidents. The cardinal features are prolonged respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, decreased level of consciousness, and low body temperature. Hypothermia may be profound (23°C/64.9°F) with myxedema coma. Severe hyponatremia may be present. Hypoglycemia and hypoxia must be excluded. The diagnosis is made by the history of hypothyroidism, characteristic physical findings, and elevated TSH. The most common precipitating cause is drugs, especially sedatives, in the elderly.\n\nPheochromocytoma crisis can mimic myxedema coma. The patient may have a history of hypertension or of a pheochromocytoma. Physical findings may include elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating elevated urine and plasma catecholamine levels.\n\nSeptic shock can also mimic myxedema coma. Physical findings may include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. The diagnosis is made by identifying the source of infection and the presence of bacteria in blood cultures.\n\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism can also mimic myxedema coma. Physical findings may include weakness, osteoporosis, and, rarely, heart failure. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating hypercalcemia and a high parathyroid hormone level.\n\nThe treatment of myxedema coma requires intensive monitoring and correction of the precipitating factors, hypoxia, and hypothermia. Intravenous levothyroxine is given, and the dosage is titrated by measuring serum T4 levels. Intravenous fluids are also given, and attention is directed toward correcting any precipitating factors. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, dexamethasone can be given.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
