    "question": "A scientist is studying the properties of myosin-actin interactions in a sample of human muscle tissue. She has identified a drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head. If she gives this drug to a sample of human muscle tissue under physiologic conditions, which of the following steps in cross-bridge cycling will most likely be blocked?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Myosin head cocking",
      "B": "Exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin",
      "C": "Myosin head binding to actin",
      "D": "Power stroke"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The drug will block the power stroke. The binding of myosin to actin is irreversible. The binding of myosin to actin is not affected by the release of phosphate. The cocking of the myosin head is affected by the release of phosphate. The exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin is not affected by the release of phosphate.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
