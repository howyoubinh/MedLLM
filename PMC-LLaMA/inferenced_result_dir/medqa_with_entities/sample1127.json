    "question": "A previously healthy 17-year-old female college student comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fever, chills, and severe headache. Her temperature is 39.4°C (103°F). Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity and photophobia. Blood cultures are obtained and a lumbar puncture is performed. A Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid shows gram-negative cocci in pairs. Which of the following virulence factors was most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Protein A",
      "B": "Lipooligosaccharides",
      "C": "Adhesive pili",
      "D": "Biofilm formation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's symptoms are typical of meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis. The initial step in the pathogenesis of infection is adhesion of the organism to the nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. This is mediated by the organism's pili. Lipooligosaccharides (LOS) are involved in cell signaling and host immune response evasion. Protein A is a cell wall component that binds to the Fc portion of IgG molecules, interfering with opsonization and phagocytosis. Biofilm formation is a virulence factor in some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, but is not a factor in Neisseria infections. Adhesive pili are found in many gram-negative bacteria and facilitate adhesion to host tissues, but are not a virulence factor in Neisseria infections.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
