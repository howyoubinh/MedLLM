    "question": "A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department. He was found unconscious on the street. The staff recognizes him as a local homeless man with a long history of alcoholism. At the hospital, his pulse is 95/min, the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the respirations are 20/min, and the oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the unconscious man is covered in bloody vomit with small clots and food particles. He smells of alcohol. A digital exam reveals black tarry stool in the rectal vault. The patient is given oxygen, IV fluids, and an NG-tube is placed and set to intermittent suction. Labs are sent and the patient is prepared for a procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Undergo colonoscopy",
      "B": "Undergo upper GI endoscopy",
      "C": "Proton pump inhibitors with anti-H.pylori regimen",
      "D": "Surgery for peptic ulcer disease"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The most common cause of upper GI bleeding is non-variceal bleeding, which is often due to peptic ulcer disease. The next step in management would be to perform an upper GI endoscopy to identify the source of the bleeding. Colonoscopy is not indicated in the acute setting. Proton pump inhibitors are used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, but should be used in combination with an anti-H.pylori regimen. Surgery for peptic ulcer disease is not indicated at this time.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
