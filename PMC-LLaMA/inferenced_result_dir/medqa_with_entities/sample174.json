    "question": "An investigator conducts a study to determine whether earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients increases survival time. One subset of study participants consists of asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with GBM after undergoing a screening MRI of the brain. The other subset of study participants was diagnosed with GBM only after they developed symptoms. Results from the study show that the asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with screening MRI had an average survival time that was 6 weeks longer than that of the patients who were diagnosed after symptom onset. Which of the following statistical biases is most likely to have occurred as a result of the endpoint selected for this study?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Observer-expectancy bias",
      "B": "Length-time bias",
      "C": "Surveillance bias",
      "D": "Lead-time bias"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Length-time bias. Length-time bias occurs when the rate of diagnosis of a disease is influenced by the duration of time that a person is observed. In this study, the screened patients were observed for a longer period of time than the non-screened patients, which likely led to the increased rate of diagnosis of GBM in the screened group. This bias is also known as \"detectability bias.\" Observer-expectancy bias. This bias occurs when the prognosis of a patient is influenced by the expectations of the health care providers. In this study, the expectations of the health care providers may have influenced the survival time of the patients, but this would not have led to the difference in survival times between the screened and non-screened patients. Surveillance bias. Surveillance bias occurs when the rate of diagnosis of a disease is influenced by the frequency of surveillance. In this study, the frequency of surveillance (i.e., the MRI screening) did not differ between the groups, so surveillance bias is not the likely explanation for the difference in survival times. Lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when the survival time of a patient is artificially increased because the time of diagnosis is advanced, but the time of death remains unchanged. In this study, the time of diagnosis was advanced for the screened patients, but the time of death did not change. Therefore, lead-time bias is not the likely explanation for the difference in survival times.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
