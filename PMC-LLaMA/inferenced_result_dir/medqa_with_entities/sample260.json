    "question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with constant abdominal pain over the past 8 hours. The pain is in her right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is also where it began. She has had no nausea or vomiting despite eating a snack 2 hours ago. She had a similar episode last month which resolved on its own. Her menstrual cycles are 28–30 days apart with 3–5 days of vaginal bleeding. Her last menses ended 9 days ago. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 78/min, the respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). Abdominal examination shows moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ which decreases with the release of pressure. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 12.5 mg/dL\nLeukocyte count 6000/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 55%\nLymphocytes 39%\nPlatelet count 260,000/mm3\nSerum  \nC-reactive protein 5 mg/L (N < 8 mg/L)\nUrine  \nRBC 1-2 phf\nWBC None\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The C-reactive protein is also at the upper limit of normal. The patient's symptoms and laboratory studies are consistent with an inflammatory process. The patient should be referred for surgery.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
