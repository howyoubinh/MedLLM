    "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a progressively growing mass in his axilla. During this period, he has had recurrent episodes of low-grade fever lasting for 7 to 10 days, and an 8-kg (18-lb) weight loss. His only medication is a multivitamin. Physical examination shows nontender, right axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. His serum calcium concentration is 15.1 mg/dL and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration is 9 pg/mL. A lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?",

  "model_response": "This patient has sarcoidosis, which is a multisystem disease of unknown cause characterized by noncaseating granulomas in many tissues. The mass in the axilla is a manifestation of generalized lymphadenopathy. The pulmonary reticulonodular densities are a manifestation of granulomatous involvement of the lungs. Sarcoidosis is often discovered when a lymph node biopsy is performed to investigate lymphadenopathy. The diagnostic feature of sarcoidosis is the presence of noncaseating granulomas in affected tissues. The granulomas are composed of tightly clustered epithelioid cells, often with Langhans or foreign body-type giant cells. Central necrosis is unusual. Granulomas may be present in any organ. In about 90% of cases, the granulomas in sarcoidosis are surrounded by lymphocytes, often with the presence of the CD4+ T-cell-derived cytokine γ-interferon. The activated T-lymphocytes form aggregates that are referred to as \"fuzzy cells.\" The etiology of sarcoidosis is unknown. The disease may occur in families, suggesting a genetic component. There is an increased incidence of sarcoidosis in northern Europe, especially in the Scandinavian countries, and in the black population in the United States. The disease is most common in the 20- to 40-year-old age group, and is more common in women than men. The noncaseating granulomas of sarcoidosis can occur in any organ. In the lung, they are usually confined to the interstitium and the hilar lymph nodes. The granulomas may resolve or conve to fibrous tissue. Fibrosis in the lung is common and may be extensive. The clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis are varied. Lymphadenopathy is the most common manifestation. Any organ may be affected, and the presentation varies depending on the organ involved. The pulmonary manifestations are variable. Some patients have severe restrictive changes with a decrease in lung volumes and diffusing capacity. Others may have an almost normal pulmonary function. About 5% to 10% of patients with sarcoidosis have hypercalcemia, which is caused by increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) by the granuloma itself. This calcitriol production is due to the presence of macrophage-derived 25-hydroxyvitamin D1α hydroxylase within the granulomas. The increased production of calcitriol results in increased absorption of calcium, with the potential for development of hypercalcemia. About 10% to 15% of patients with sarcoidosis have an abnormality of the electrical system in the heart, with decreased voltage and a widened QRS complex. This is due to involvement of the conducting system in the heart by sarcoidosis. The granulomas in the heart may also be infiltrative, destroying the myocardium and resulting in cardiac failure. The eye involvement in sarcoidosis is referred to as uveitis. It may be unilateral or bilateral and may cause blindness. The involvement of the skin by sarcoidosis can result in the appearance of small, erythematous, scaly lesions, or it may result in large, thickened plaques. The lesions are often found around the nose, eyes, and cheeks. The 55-year-old man with sarcoidosis and a history of recurrent low-grade fever, weight loss, and a mass in the axilla has a multisystem disease. The abnormalities in calcium metabolism, with hypercalcemia and suppressed PTH, are due to the increased production of calcitriol by the granulomas. The granulomas in the lung may result in a restrictive lung disease picture, or they may be asymptomatic. The involvement of the eye and skin can cause uveitis and skin lesions. The involvement of the nervous system can result in aseptic meningitis and cranial neuropathies. The involvement of the heart can cause conduction defects. The involvement of the liver can cause hepatomegaly and elevation of the liver",
