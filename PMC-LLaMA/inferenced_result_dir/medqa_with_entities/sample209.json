    "question": "A 58-year-old white man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a painless lesion on his lower lip. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He has worked as a fruit picker for the past 25 years. His current medications include captopril and metformin. Examination of the oral cavity shows a single ulcer near the vermillion border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Squamous cell carcinoma",
      "B": "Aphthous stomatitis",
      "C": "Actinic keratosis",
      "D": "Traumatic ulcer"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity is increased in individuals with a history of smoking, alcohol use, or both. The incidence is also higher in individuals with chronic poor oral hygiene, poor nutrition, and lower socioeconomic status. The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is also higher in African Americans and in individuals with a history of ionizing radiation exposure. Actinic keratosis is a premalignant lesion of the lip often seen in individuals with chronic sun exposure. Aphthous stomatitis is a common disease that causes painful, recurrent ulcers of the oral cavity. Traumatic ulcers are self-explanatory. Herpangina is a viral infection of the oral cavity that causes painful ulcerations.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
