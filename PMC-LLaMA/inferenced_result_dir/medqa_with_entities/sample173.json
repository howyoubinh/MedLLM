    "question": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches during the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Her only medication is a multivitamin. A metyrapone stimulation test is performed and the results rule out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increase in serum ACTH",
      "B": "Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids",
      "C": "Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol",
      "D": "Increase in serum cortisol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The metyrapone stimulation test is used to assess hypothalamic-pituitary function. Metyrapone inhibits 11-b-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. In patients with Cushing's syndrome, the increase in ACTH due to loss of feedback inhibition results in an increase in 11-deoxycortisol. Following administration of metyrapone, 11-deoxycortisol levels decrease, and cortisol levels increase because the block in the synthesis of cortisol at the 11-deoxycortisol step allows corticosterone to be converted to cortisol. Urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids are increased in patients with Cushing's syndrome because of the increased glucocorticoid production.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
