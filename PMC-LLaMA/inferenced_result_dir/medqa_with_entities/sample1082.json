    "question": "An 81-year-old man patient recently moved into an assisted living facility and presents today with itchy blisters in his axilla. He attributes these to a poor diet. He also complains that the nurse practitioner at the facility started him on 4 new medications, in addition to his existing prescriptions. On physical examination, tense axillary bullae are noted that do not rupture with light, gloved touch. On direct immunofluorescence, linear C3 and IgG deposits are seen along the basement membrane. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome",
      "B": "Bullous pemphigoid",
      "C": "Pemphigus vulgaris",
      "D": "Cicatricial pemphigoid"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. Bullous pemphigoid. This is a type of autoimmune blistering disease that typically affects the elderly. It is characterized by tense bullae that do not rupture with light, gloved touch. On direct immunofluorescence, linear C3 and IgG deposits are seen along the basement membrane. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is caused by an exfoliative toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by widespread erythema and superficial, flaccid bullae that rupture easily. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by mucosal involvement, typically oral. Cicatricial pemphigoid is characterized by scarring and occurs in middle-aged women.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
