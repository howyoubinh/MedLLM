    "question": "An unconscious 55-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by ambulance. He had recently lost his job and his house was about to begin foreclosure. His adult children were concerned for his well being and called the police requesting a welfare check. He was found unresponsive in his gurague. There were several empty bottles of vodka around him and one half empty container of antifreeze. A review of his medical records reveals that he was previously in good health. Upon arrival to the ED he regains consciousness.  His blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical exam his speech is slurred and he has difficulty following commands. His abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL. Which of the following findings would be expected in this patient’s urine?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Calcium oxalate crystals",
      "B": "Hyaline casts",
      "C": "Urine ketones",
      "D": "Urate crystals"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s urine would be expected to contain calcium oxalate crystals. Ethylene glycol, as well as methanol and isopropyl alcohol, can cause severe acidosis and renal failure. The presence of an osmolar gap in the serum is suggestive of one of these ingestions. In addition, oxalate crystals can be seen in the urine due to the ingestion of ethylene glycol. The crystals have a characteristic calcium oxalate “salt-like” appearance and are usually seen in the urine of patients with an elevated urine osmolality. Hyaline casts are seen in normal individuals and those with renal disease. Urine ketones are seen in diabetic ketoacidosis and starvation. Urate crystals are seen in patients with gout.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
