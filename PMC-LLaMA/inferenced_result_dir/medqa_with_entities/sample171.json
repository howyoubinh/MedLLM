    "question": "A 38-year-old G4P3 presents to her obstetrician’s office for her 20-week anatomy ultrasound. She reports that she feels well and has not experienced any contractions or vaginal bleeding. She also reports good fetal movement. The patient declined prenatal screening earlier in the pregnancy for religious reasons but would now like an anatomy ultrasound to ensure the fetus is growing appropriately. The patient’s previous pregnancies were uncomplicated, and she delivered three healthy babies at full term. On the ultrasound, the technician observes a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). She also notes microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The technician further notes a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is 26 cm.\n\nWhich of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this fetus?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cleft palate",
      "B": "Epicanthal folds",
      "C": "Micropthlamia",
      "D": "Prominent occiput"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ultrasound findings are most consistent with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). The most common additional findings in Down syndrome include a flat facial profile, an upward slant of the eye, small ears, and a short, broad neck. Other common findings include congenital heart disease, such as a VSD, duodenal atresia, and increased nuchal translucency. Epicanthal folds, cleft palate, micropthalmia, and a prominent occiput are less commonly seen in Down syndrome.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
