    "question": "A 75-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 3-day history of a productive cough and shortness of breath. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F) and respirations are 32/min. Crackles are heard over the right upper and the entire left lung fields. Sputum culture confirms infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite appropriate therapy, the patient dies. A photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy is shown. Which of the following mediators is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Platelet activating factor",
      "B": "Interferon-gamma",
      "C": "Interleukin-10",
      "D": "Leukotriene D4"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The photomicrograph shows numerous eosinophils in the lung. The presence of these cells suggests an immediate (type I) hypersensitivity reaction. The most likely mediator involved in the recruitment of these cells is interleukin-5. Eosinophils are not typically found in large numbers in the lungs except in the setting of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction or in diseases such as asthma. Platelet-activating factor (A) is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils. Interferon-gamma (B) is involved in the activation of macrophages. Interleukin-10 (C) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Leukotriene D4 (E) is involved in the recruitment of eosinophils.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
