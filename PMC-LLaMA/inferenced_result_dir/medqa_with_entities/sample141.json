    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 142 mEq/L\nCl-: 102 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 314 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.1 mg/dL\nAST: 9 U/L\nALT: 8 U/L\n24-hour urinary cortisol: 470 µg (< 300 µg)\nSerum cortisol 30 µg/mL (5-23 µg/dL)\nSerum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)\n\nA 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?",
