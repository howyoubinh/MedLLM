    "question": "A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was “pretty cold” in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32°C (89.6°F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Lisinopril",
      "B": "Fluphenazine",
      "C": "Levothyroxine",
      "D": "Atorvastatin\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). It is most likely caused by a drug-induced hypermetabolic state with increased heat production and impaired central thermoregulation. Drugs that block dopamine receptors are most commonly associated with NMS, including antipsychotic agents such as fluphenazine. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used to treat hypertension. Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism. Atorvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering agent. Each of these drugs is less likely to cause NMS.\n\n###COMMENTS\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially life-threatening reaction to neuroleptic or antipsychotic drugs. It is characterized by marked rigidity, immobility, tremors, fever, fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate, diaphoresis, and autonomic instability. It occurs in the first few weeks after initiation of antipsychotic therapy, although the onset may be delayed. The mortality rate is 10%-20%. The most common cause of death is acute renal failure secondary to myoglobin precipitation in the renal tubules. The treatment of choice is the immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic agent. Dantrolene, a directly acting muscle relaxant, may be helpful in treating the rigidity and hyperthermia. Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, has also been used with some success.\n\nHypothyroidism can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including confusion, but the patient's core body temperature is usually normal. Cholesterol-lowering agents have been associated with a variety of side effects, including rhabdomyolysis, but not with neurological symptoms. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used to treat hypertension. It is not associated with neurological symptoms.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
