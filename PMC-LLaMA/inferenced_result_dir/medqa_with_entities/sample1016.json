    "question": "An 18-year-old male is brought in by fire rescue. The patient was an unrestrained passenger in a motor vehicle crash and was ejected from the vehicle after collision. Upon arrival to the trauma bay, the patient has a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6. He is rapidly intubated, and vitals are a temperature of 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/64 mmHg. He is noted to have multiple ecchymoses over his body, as well as petechiae and purpura. He has a laceration over his clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage. Radiographs of his lower extremity show multiple long bone fractures. Two large bore IV lines are placed, and the patient oozes from around the sites of venepuncture. Labs are notable for a WBC of 20,000/mm^3, Hb of 10.1g/dL, platelets of 48,000/mm^3, and prolongation of the PT and aPTT. This patient's presentation can best be explained by which of the following diagnoses?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Air embolization",
      "B": "Tension pneumothorax",
      "C": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation",
      "D": "Coagulopathy of trauma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is a feared complication of severe trauma, sepsis, and certain malignancies. It is characterized by widespread activation of coagulation, leading to both thrombosis and hemorrhage. The consumption of coagulation factors and platelets leads to bleeding from venepuncture sites, as well as oozing from the skin. The laboratory findings in this patient are consistent with DIC, as the PT and aPTT are prolonged, and the platelet count is low. The other choices are unlikely to be the cause of this patient's presentation. Air embolization can occur in the setting of trauma, but it is unlikely to cause the skin findings seen in this patient. Tension pneumothorax and coagulopathy of trauma can both cause bleeding from venepuncture sites, but they would not cause the skin findings seen in this patient. Coagulopathy of trauma is unlikely to cause the low platelet count seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
