    "question": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of irregular menstrual bleeding. Menses have occurred at 45- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 15 years. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. The patient reports that she was too embarrassed to discuss this issue with anyone until now. Over the past two years, she was unable to become pregnant despite having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband on a regular basis. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 85 kg (187 lb); BMI is 29.4 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe facial acne. There is abnormal pigmented hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. The patient wishes to have children. In addition to recommending lifestyle modifications, which of the following is the most appropriate step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "In vitro fertilization with patient's egg",
      "B": "Progesterone therapy",
      "C": "Clomiphene therapy",
      "D": "Leuprolide therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has PCOS. The ovaries are enlarged and have a smooth, thickened capsule. The cut surface shows a multitude of small cysts (later identified as follicles) arranged in a cluster around the periphery, with a central stellate scar. The patient is obese, with a BMI of 29.4 kg/m2. Obesity and hirsutism are common in PCOS. The patient has not menstruated for 5 weeks, and progesterone therapy will induce a withdrawal bleed. Clomiphene therapy is used to induce ovulation in patients who are anovulatory. Leuprolide therapy is used to suppress the abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. In vitro fertilization with the patient's egg is not appropriate because she is hirsute and has not menstruated for 5 weeks.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
