    "question": "A 1900-g (4-lb 3-oz) newborn is delivered at term to a 36-year-old primigravid woman. Pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios. Apgar scores are 7 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. He is at the 2nd percentile for head circumference and 15th percentile for length. Examination shows a prominent posterior part of the head. The ears are low-set and the jaw is small and retracted. The fists are clenched, with overlapping second and third fingers. The calcaneal bones are prominent and the plantar surface of the foot shows a convex deformity. Abdominal examination shows an omphalocele. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ventricular septal defect",
      "B": "Ebstein's anomaly",
      "C": "Pheochromocytoma",
      "D": "Holoprosencephaly"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings depicted in the question stem are those of the Down syndrome syndrome. The most common cardiac defect in Down syndrome is a ventricular septal defect, which occurs in about half of these patients. Other common cardiac defects include atrioventricular canal defects and atrial septal defects. The most common abdominal abnormality is a patent ductus arteriosus. The incidence of cardiac defects is about 45% in Down syndrome. The other choices are unrelated to Down syndrome.\n\nTrisomy 21 is the most common trisomy. The incidence of trisomy 21 is 1 in 800 live births. The incidence increases as maternal age increases. The mean IQ of children with Down syndrome is 28. The life expectancy is reduced, with most patients dying in the second decade of life. The cause of death is usually congenital heart disease.\n\nThe risk of recurrence of Down syndrome in a family is increased if the mother is the carrier of a balanced translocation. If the father has a balanced translocation, the risk of recurrence is negligible.\n\nIn addition to the findings listed in the question stem, these children often have other anomalies, including strabismus, nystagmus, and sensorineural hearing loss. Brushfield spots on the iris are also common.\n\nThe diagnosis is best established with a karyotype. The other tests are not specific for Down syndrome.\n\nManagement is directed at the specific abnormalities found on evaluation. In addition, patients should be referred for early intervention programs, such as those for hearing loss.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
