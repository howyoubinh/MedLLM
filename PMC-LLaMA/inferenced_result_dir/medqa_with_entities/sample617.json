    "question": "A microbiologist has isolated several colonies of Escherichia coli on an agar plate. The microbiologist exposes the agar plate to ciprofloxacin, which destroys all of the bacteria except for one surviving colony. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Replacement of D-alanine",
      "B": "Mutation of DNA gyrase",
      "C": "Inactivation by bacterial transferase",
      "D": "Modification of surface binding proteins"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The microbiologist has performed a susceptibility test, which allows him to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic for a bacterium. The MIC is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that will inhibit bacterial growth. The microbiologist has determined that the MIC of ciprofloxacin for the bacterium is 0.1 mg/mL. The bacterium is therefore resistant to ciprofloxacin.\n\nThe most common mechanism of antibiotic resistance is mutation of the DNA gyrase. The DNA gyrase is an essential bacterial enzyme that is targeted by fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin. A mutation in the DNA gyrase will prevent the antibiotic from binding to its target, and thus confer resistance to the antibiotic.\n\nThe other proposed mechanisms of antibiotic resistance do not apply in this case. Replacement of D-alanine with D-lactate in the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall would confer resistance to penicillin, not ciprofloxacin. Inactivation by bacterial transferase refers to acetylation of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which would not confer resistance to ciprofloxacin. Modification of surface binding proteins would also not confer resistance to ciprofloxacin, as ciprofloxacin acts intracellularly on the DNA gyrase.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony is mutation of the DNA gyrase.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
