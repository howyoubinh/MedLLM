    "question": "A 1-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her parents. They are concerned that she becomes lethargic and irritated between meals. They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?",

  "model_response": "The child has hereditary fructose intolerance. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is an allosteric activator of aldolase B, which cleaves fructose 1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. A deficiency of aldolase B results in hereditary fructose intolerance. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate inhibits glycogen phosphorylase and blocks glycogenolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibits the production of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which is necessary for the production of glucose by gluconeogenesis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate also inhibits glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is necessary for the production of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The accumulation of glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibits triose phosphate isomerase. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate also inhibits phosphofructokinase, which is necessary for the production of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate inhibits aldolase A, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits phosphoglycerate kinase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate and glyceraldehyde inhibits phosphoglycerate mutase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits enolase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits hexokinase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits phosphofructokinase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits aldolase A, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits phosphoglycerate kinase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits phosphoglycerate mutase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits enolase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits glucokinase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits lactate dehydrogenase, which is necessary for glycolysis. The accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate inhibits pyruvate kinase, which is necessary for glycolysis.
