    "question": "A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of intermittent flank pain. Over the past 2 years, she has had five urinary tract infections. Her blood pressure is 150/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses. Serum studies show a urea nitrogen concentration of 29 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.4 mg/dL. Renal ultrasonography shows bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Medullary sponge kidney",
      "B": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease",
      "C": "Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease",
      "D": "Obstructive cystic dysplasia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings are typical for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The disease is characterized by the presence of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney. The cysts are usually bilateral and may be found in the coex and medulla. The disease is progressive, leading to renal failure in middle to late adulthood. Hypertension is common. The other choices do not give the bilateral manifestations seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
