    "question": "A 7-month-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician by his mother. She reports that the child develops severe sunburns every time the infant is exposed to sunlight. She has applied copious amounts of sunscreen to the infant but this has not helped the problem. On examination, there are multiple areas of reddened skin primarily in sun exposed areas. The childâ€™s corneas appear irritated and erythematous. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nucleotide excision repair",
      "B": "Non-homologous end joining",
      "C": "Homologous recombination",
      "D": "Mismatch repair"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The child has the symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum, which is a disorder of DNA repair. Nucleotide excision repair is defective in this disorder. This process is responsible for the removal of thymine dimers caused by UV radiation. Non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination are processes used in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Mismatch repair is a process that corrects errors in DNA replication.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
