    "question": "A 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension returns to his cardiologist for ongoing blood pressure management. He reports feeling fine with no trouble with his medications. He exercises regularly and sleeps well without snoring or daytime somnolence. His blood pressure measurements in the past have ranged from 160 - 170/80 - 100 mmHg. Today, his pressure is 150/100 mmHg with a pulse of 65/min while on hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril. Physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 is appreciated at the right upper sternal border. There is unremarkable carotid, renal, or abdominal bruits. What is the most common cause of his hypertension?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Primary hyperaldosteronism",
      "B": "Hypothyroidism",
      "C": "Stiffening of the aorta",
      "D": "Aortic stenosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most common cause of hypertension in this patient is primary hyperaldosteronism. The murmur is likely due to aortic sclerosis. Primary hyperaldosteronism is a cause of hypertension and hypokalemia. It is most commonly due to an adrenal adenoma. It can be confirmed by demonstrating increased aldosterone secretion (aldosterone level > 10 ng/dL) in the setting of hypertension and hypokalemia. Hypothyroidism can cause hypertension, but the patient does not have other signs or symptoms of this condition. Stiffening of the aorta is more common in older women and is not related to hypertension. Aortic stenosis can cause angina, syncope, and congestive heart failure, but not hypertension.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
