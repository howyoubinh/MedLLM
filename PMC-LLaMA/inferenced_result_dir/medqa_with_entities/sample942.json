    "question": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of difficulty sleeping and fatigue. Menses occur at irregular 35- to 50-day intervals and last 3–7 days. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. She has had an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight gain over this period. She also reports decreased sexual desire and increased hair growth on her face and arms. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows central obesity, increased pigmented hair over the chin and upper lip, and purple stretch marks on the abdomen. She has a prominent hump of fat over the base of the dorsum of her neck and decreased proximal muscle tone and strength. Serum studies show:\nNa+ 154 mEq/L\nK+ 2.8 mEq/L\nCl- 103 mEq/L\nHCO3- 30 mEq/L\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nGlucose 236 mg/dL\nACTH 2 pg/mL (N = 7–50)\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Adrenalectomy",
      "B": "Polychemotherapy and radiation therapy",
      "C": "Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy",
      "D": "Partial nephrectomy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has Cushing syndrome secondary to an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumor. The diagnosis is established by demonstrating increased 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels, lack of normal suppression by dexamethasone, and presence of an inappropriately elevated ACTH level. The most appropriate treatment is transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, which is 90% successful in curing Cushing syndrome. Adrenalectomy would be indicated only if the pituitary tumor was not visualized by MRI or if the patient had a primary adrenal tumor. Polychemotherapy and radiation therapy are used to treat patients with small cell lung cancer, which can cause ectopic ACTH secretion. Partial nephrectomy is used to treat renal cell carcinoma, which can also cause ectopic ACTH secretion.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
