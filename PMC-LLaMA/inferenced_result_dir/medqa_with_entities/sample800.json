    "question": "A 4-year-old child is rushed to the emergency department after developing sudden abdominal pain followed by nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool. Prior to the onset of symptoms, he was seen playing with his mother’s purse containing a bottle of vitamin supplements, which she takes for chronic microcytic anemia. Which of the following medications is the treatment for this patient's intoxication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dimercaprol",
      "B": "Deferoxamine",
      "C": "Protamine",
      "D": "Succimer"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The child has developed acute iron poisoning after ingesting a large number of ferrous sulfate tablets. Iron tablets are commonly found in multivitamin bottles. The treatment for acute iron poisoning is deferoxamine, a chelating agent that binds iron and is excreted in the urine. Dimercaprol is a chelating agent used in the treatment of heavy metal poisoning (e.g., lead). Protamine is a medication used to neutralize heparin. Succimer is a chelating agent used in the treatment of lead and mercury poisoning.\n\n###COMMENT: Deferoxamine chelates iron to yield ferrioxamine, which is excreted in the urine.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
