    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents to the clinic after several months of weight loss. She noticed a 6.8 kg (15 lb) unintentional weight loss over the preceding several months. She has not changed her diet or exercise habits. She also reports feuding with her boyfriend over the temperature of their shared apartment, as she always feels warmer than he does. The vital signs include: heart rate 110/min and blood pressure 146/78 mm Hg. The physical exam is notable for warm and slightly moist skin. She also exhibits a fine tremor in her hands when her arms are outstretched. The urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the best single treatment option for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Glucocorticoids",
      "B": "Methimazole",
      "C": "Propranolol",
      "D": "Radioiodine therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has Graves' disease, which is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The initial treatment of choice is usually a beta blocker to control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia and tremor. It is also helpful in controlling the symptoms of anxiety that many of these patients experience. In addition, patients are often treated with a small dose of glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, to help control the underlying thyroid disease. Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker that is effective in controlling the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. It is contraindicated in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or heart block. Methimazole is an antithyroid medication that is effective in treating Graves' disease. It is contraindicated in pregnancy, as it can cross the placenta and cause fetal aplasia cutis. Radioactive iodine is also an effective treatment for Graves' disease. It is usually reserved for patients over 40 years of age, or for patients who have contraindications to antithyroid medications. It is also contraindicated in pregnancy, as it can cross the placenta and affect the fetal thyroid. Thyroidectomy is usually reserved for patients who have had multiple relapses after medical treatment, or for patients who have a very large thyroid gland that is compressing on vital structures, such as the trachea or esophagus.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
