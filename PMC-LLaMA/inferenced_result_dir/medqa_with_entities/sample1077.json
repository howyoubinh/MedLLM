    "question": "A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with fatigue. He has been seen in the emergency room 5 times in the past 2 years for acute alcohol intoxication. His past medical history is notable for diabetes mellitus and gout. He takes metformin, glyburide, and allopurinol. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 16/min. He is in no acute distress. A positive fluid wave is noted. The dorsal surface of the tongue is depapillated, and there are erythematous swollen patches at the oral commissures. A complete blood count and iron studies are reported below:\n\nHemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL\nHematocrit: 36%\nLeukocyte count: 6,000/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 170,000/mm^3\n\nMean corpuscular volume: 70 um^3\nIron: 250 ug/dL\nFerritin: 300 ng/mL\nTotal iron binding capacity: 200 mcg/dL^3\n\nWhich of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",
