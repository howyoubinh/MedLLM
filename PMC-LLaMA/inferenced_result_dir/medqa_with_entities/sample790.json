    "question": "A 56-year-old patient is being treated with oral amoxicillin for community-acquired pneumonia. The plasma clearance of the drug is calculated as 15.0 L/h. Oral bioavailability of the drug is 75%. Sensitivity analysis of a sputum culture shows a minimal inhibitory concentration of 1 Î¼g/mL for the causative pathogen. The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L. If the drug is administered twice per day, which of the following dosages should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state?",
    "options": {
      "A": "270 mg",
      "B": "480 mg",
      "C": "240 mg",
      "D": "540 mg\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The total daily dose required to maintain the target plasma concentration is:\nD = 2 mg/L x 15 L/h = 30 mg/h\nThe area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is the most important parameter in the case of amoxicillin because it relates concentration to the total amount of drug that is absorbed. The AUC is given by:\nAUC = 0 D A / 0 D C\nwhere AUC is the area under the curve, D is the total daily dose, A is the amount of drug absorbed per dose, and C is the plasma concentration.\nSubstituting in the values for D and A, we find:\nAUC = 30 mg/h x 15 L/h / 0.75 x 1 mg/L = 1500 mg-h/L\nThe dosage required to attain the target plasma concentration is:\nD = AUC x target plasma concentration / 0.75\nD = 1500 mg-h/L x 2 mg/L / 0.75\nD = 6000 mg\nThe dosage required to maintain the target plasma concentration is therefore 6000 mg administered twice per day, or 3000 mg per dose.\n\n###OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
