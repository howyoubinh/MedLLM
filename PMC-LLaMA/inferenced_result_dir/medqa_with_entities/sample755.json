    "question": "A 31-year-old G1-P0 woman at 28-weeks gestation presents with shortness of breath and nonspecific right-sided chest pain that is worse with inspiration. She works as a graduate student at the local university, and she informs you that she recently returned to the west coast from a trip to New York for an Economics conference. Her medical history is positive only for frequent bouts of sinusitis. She currently denies any smoking, drinks a glass of red wine/day, and she denies any past illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Her physical examination shows decreased air movement throughout the right lung but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus without acute findings. On physical examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic to 121/min, normotensive, and demonstrates an O2 saturation of 92%. Which of the following is the best next step in the evaluation of the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "ECG",
      "B": "Chest radiography",
      "C": "V/Q scan",
      "D": "CT pulmonary angiogram"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation of this patient is most consistent with a pulmonary embolism. The risk factors include the recent travel, the recent conference, and the fact that she is post-partum (and thus at risk for osteoporosis and subsequent deep venous thrombosis). The physical examination is remarkable for decreased air movement throughout the right lung, which is consistent with a right-sided pulmonary embolism. The murmur is likely an early diastolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation. The next step in the evaluation of a patient with suspected pulmonary embolism includes obtaining a chest radiograph, which is normal in this case. An ECG is indicated if there is concern for an acute coronary syndrome, which is not present in this patient. A V/Q scan is indicated if there is concern for a pulmonary embolism, but the patient has a normal chest radiograph. A CT pulmonary angiogram is the best test to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism, but it is not indicated as the first step in the evaluation. The best initial test is a D-dimer assay, which is a sensitive but not specific test for a pulmonary embolism.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
