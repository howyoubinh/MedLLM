    "question": "A 2-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her concerned father. He states that ever since her uncomplicated delivery she has failed to gain weight, has had chronic diarrhea, and has had multiple bacterial and viral infections. During the course of the workup, an absent thymic shadow is noted and a lymph node biopsy demonstrates the absence of germinal centers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Defect in ATM gene",
      "B": "Adenosine deaminase deficiency",
      "C": "NADPH oxidase deficiency",
      "D": "Defect in BTK gene"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The absence of a thymic shadow and the lack of germinal centers in the lymph node biopsy are characteristic findings in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The most common form of SCID is X-linked and is caused by a mutation in the common g chain for cytokine receptors. Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a form of SCID that is autosomal recessive. Adenosine deaminase deficiency accounts for 15% of autosomal recessive forms of SCID. Adenosine deaminase deficiency results in the accumulation of deoxyadenosine, which is toxic to lymphocytes. Patients with a deficiency in NADPH oxidase can also present with SCID. This form of SCID is associated with chronic granulomatous disease. Chronic granulomatous disease is characterized by recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms. Patients with a defect in the BTK gene can also present with SCID. This form of SCID is associated with the absence of B cells.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
