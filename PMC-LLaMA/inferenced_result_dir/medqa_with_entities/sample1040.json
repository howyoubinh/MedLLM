    "question": "A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of worsening upper abdominal pain for the past 8 hours. She reports that the pain radiates to her back and is associated with nausea. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which she takes enalapril, furosemide, and simvastatin. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure is 84/58 mm Hg, and pulse is 115/min. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Examination shows abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness and guarding. Bowel sounds are decreased. Extremities are warm. Laboratory studies show:\nHematocrit 48%\nLeukocyte count 13,800/mm3\nPlatelet count 175,000/mm3\nSerum  \nCalcium 8.0 mg/dL\nUrea nitrogen 32 mg/dL\nAmylase 250 U/L\nAn ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vital sign abnormalities?",
