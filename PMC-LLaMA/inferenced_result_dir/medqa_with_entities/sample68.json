    "question": "A 57-year-old female with a past medical history of alcoholism presents to the emergency room vomiting bright red blood. She is accompanied by her partner, who reports that she had been complaining of black and tarry stools for the past several days. Vital signs are temperature 37 degrees celsius, heart rate 141 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/60, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. On physical examination, she has splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave. The remainder of her examination is within normal limits. The patient is stabilized with intravenous fluids, and her blood pressure improves. Subsequent emergent upper endoscopy reveals bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus, but no gastric bleed. In the endoscopy suite she also receives IV octreotide. After intervention and resolution of her acute bleed, which of the following pharmacologic agents is indicated?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Phentolamine",
      "B": "Prazosin",
      "C": "Nifedipine",
      "D": "Nadalol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has esophageal variceal bleeding, which is most commonly caused by alcoholic cirrhosis. The acute bleed in this patient was most likely treated with octreotide, which reduces splanchnic blood flow and therefore reduces poal pressure. However, this therapy does not prevent re-bleeding, which is usually treated with beta-blockers. Phentolamine is a short-acting alpha-blocker that is used in acute variceal bleeding to reduce poal pressure. Prazosin is a long-acting alpha-1-blocker that is used for prevention of re-bleeding. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is also used for prevention of re-bleeding. Nadalol is a non-selective beta-blocker with alphablocking properties that is also used for prevention of re-bleeding.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
