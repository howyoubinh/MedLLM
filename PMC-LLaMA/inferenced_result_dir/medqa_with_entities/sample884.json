    "question": "The ribosome is an essential organelle that plays an important role in the synthesis of new proteins. The location of the ribosome within the cell can vary and provides a clue to the function of the particular cell. What ribosome location is essential for protein-secreting cells?",

      "A": "Rough endoplasmic reticulum",
      "B": "Smooth endoplasmic reticulum",
      "C": "Cytosol",

  "model_response": "The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes bind to the RER and begin protein synthesis. Proteins are made in this organelle and then sent to the Golgi apparatus for packaging. The RER is only found in cells that synthesize proteins, such as protein-secreting cells. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification. The SER is found in all cells. The cytosol is the fluid component of the cytoplasm. The nucleus is the control center of the cell and contains the genetic material.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
