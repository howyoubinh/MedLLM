    "question": "A 46-year-old woman presents with a 5-month history of worsening dry cough, occasional shortness of breath, and fatigue. She says she is now having trouble walking a full block. For the past week, she also has noticed bilateral swelling of the lower legs. She denies chest pain, fever, chills, syncope, or bloody sputum. Current vitals include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 63/min, blood pressure 128/91 mm Hg and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, there is elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest X-ray demonstrates a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bronchoalveolar wash",
      "B": "Pulmonary function studies",
      "C": "Echocardiography",
      "D": "Chest CT"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical scenario suggests a possible diagnosis of pulmonary congestion due to left ventricular failure. The next best step in the diagnosis of this patient would be to perform echocardiography to assess left ventricular function and valvular morphology. Echocardiography is a non-invasive tool that can provide information about cardiac chamber size, wall motion, valvular function, and the pericardium. Pulmonary function studies could be considered if there were clinical signs of obstructive or restrictive lung disease, but this patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with left ventricular failure. A bronchoalveolar wash would be indicated if there were clinical signs of an infection, but this patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with left ventricular failure. A chest CT scan could be considered if there were clinical signs of a pulmonary embolism, but this patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with left ventricular failure.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
