    "question": "A 7-day-old infant boy presents to an emergency department due to poor feeding. His parents are recent immigrants to the United States. He was born in a traditional home birth and has never seen a medical provider. Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg. On exam, the infant has increased tone, a clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands. Initial screening bloodwork is normal. What is the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Clostridium botulinum",
      "B": "Clostridium tetani",
      "C": "Group B streptococcus",
      "D": "Listeria monocytogenes"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This is a case of neonatal tetanus. The infant's age, poor feeding, altered tone, and increased respiratory rate are all consistent with neonatal tetanus. The increased tone, clenched jaw, and clenched hands are all characteristic of a \"trismus\" or \"risus sardonicus\" presentation. The mother did not receive prenatal care, so she did not receive a tetanus booster, which would have protected the infant. Clostridium botulinum causes botulism, which is associated with a descending paralysis. Group B streptococcus can cause sepsis in neonates, but it is not associated with trismus. Listeria monocytogenes can cause meningitis in infants, but it is not associated with trismus.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
