He seems very frustrated about her diminishing ability to take care of herself the way she used to and no longer thinks he can trust her watching his children. At her last visit you noted mild cognitive impairment. Today, she appears withdrawn and hesitates to make eye-contact with you. She lets her son do most of the talking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",

      "A": "Discuss with the son the challenges of having a parent with dementia",
      "B": "Complete a mini-mental exam",
