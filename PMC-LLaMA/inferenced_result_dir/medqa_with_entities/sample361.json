    "question": "A 6-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because he has become increasingly irritable and restless over the past 2 days. During this period, he has had 12 bowel movements. He feeds 10 to 12 times a day. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation and weighed 1800 g (3 lb 15 oz); he currently weighs 1700 g (3 lb 12 oz). His mother has Graves' disease and received propylthiouracil during the last trimester of pregnancy. She has a history of intravenous heroin use. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 180/min, and respirations are 50/min. Examination shows mild diaphoresis and a firm 2-cm midline neck swelling. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Methimazole and propranolol therapy",
      "B": "Potassium iodide therapy",
      "C": "Naloxone therapy",
      "D": "Calcium gluconate therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical findings are most consistent with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. This is a rare condition that occurs in newborns of mothers with Graves' disease who have been treated with propylthiouracil. The onset of symptoms usually occurs on the first day of life. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating elevated serum unbound thyroxine levels. Treatment consists of propranolol, 2 mg/kg per dose every 4 hours, to control the symptoms of increased sympathetic tone. Methimazole is also given at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg per day. In addition, the newborn should be given prophylactic treatment for candidiasis.\n\nThe treatment of thyrotoxicosis with iodides or thyroidectomy is contraindicated in the newborn because these measures may precipitate thyroid crisis. Calcium gluconate therapy is used in thyrotoxic crisis, not in the treatment of neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Naloxone is used to reverse the effects of opioid use.\n\nThe firm midline neck mass is a enlarged thyroid gland. The increased thyroid hormone levels may cause tachycardia and hypertension. The increased metabolic rate may cause increased insensible water loss and diaphoresis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
