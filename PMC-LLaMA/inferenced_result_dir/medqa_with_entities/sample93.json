    "question": "A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient’s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient’s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a \"clunk\" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cerebral palsy",
      "B": "Diabetes mellitus",
      "C": "Down syndrome",
      "D": "Rheumatoid arthritis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration (SACD) of the spinal cord secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient’s mental retardation and poorly controlled diabetes are likely contributing factors to her development of this condition. The \"clunk\" that is felt when force is applied to the head and neck is known as a \"spacer\" and is pathognomonic for SACD. The other listed conditions are not associated with SACD.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

In emergency and/or for short-time use, esophageal obturation with one- or two-lumen tubes and oropharyngeal artificial airways are typically used. For a few days of intubation, nasopharyngeal artificial airways are the most commonly used devices, while for longer periods (up to three weeks) endotracheal tubes are the preferred devices.
