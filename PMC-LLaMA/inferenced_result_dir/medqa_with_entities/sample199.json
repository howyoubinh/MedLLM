    "question": "A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. A voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Glomerular crescents with macrophages",
      "B": "Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation",
      "C": "Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy",
      "D": "Thickened glomerular capillary loops"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings are those of reflux nephropathy, which is caused by the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys during micturition. The pressure in the renal pelvis increases, and the pressure differential across the renal cortex drives the urine into the renal cortex. The result is focal thinning of the renal cortex, with atrophy of the tubules and loss of cortical architecture. The remaining parenchyma is normal. The other choices are not associated with reflux nephropathy.Diagnosis: Reflux nephropathy\n\n### BRS Gross Examination 2\n\n### BRS Histology 2\n\n### BRS Pathology 2\n\n### BRS Renal Disease 2\n\n### BRS Urology 2\n\n### BRS Pediatric 2\n\n### BRS Dermatology 2\n\n### BRS Ophthalmology 2\n\n### BRS Otolaryngology 2\n\n### BRS Surgery 2\n\n### BRS Obstetrics & Gynecology 2\n\n### BRS Preventive Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Psychiatry 2\n\n### BRS Internal Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Neurology 2\n\n### BRS Dermatology 2\n\n### BRS Ophthalmology 2\n\n### BRS Otolaryngology 2\n\n### BRS Surgery 2\n\n### BRS Obstetrics & Gynecology 2\n\n### BRS Preventive Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Psychiatry 2\n\n### BRS Internal Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Neurology 2\n\n### BRS Urology 2\n\n### BRS Pathology 2\n\n### BRS Renal Disease 2\n\n### BRS Gross Examination 2\n\n### BRS Histology 2\n\n### BRS Pediatric 2\n\n### BRS Dermatology 2\n\n### BRS Ophthalmology 2\n\n### BRS Otolaryngology 2\n\n### BRS Surgery 2\n\n### BRS Obstetrics & Gynecology 2\n\n### BRS Preventive Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Psychiatry 2\n\n### BRS Internal Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Neurology 2\n\n### BRS Urology 2\n\n### BRS Pathology 2\n\n### BRS Renal Disease 2\n\n### BRS Gross Examination 2\n\n### BRS Histology 2\n\n### BRS Pediatric 2\n\n### BRS Dermatology 2\n\n### BRS Ophthalmology 2\n\n### BRS Otolaryngology 2\n\n### BRS Surgery 2\n\n### BRS Obstetrics & Gynecology 2\n\n### BRS Preventive Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Psychiatry 2\n\n### BRS Internal Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Neurology 2\n\n### BRS Urology 2\n\n### BRS Pathology 2\n\n### BRS Renal Disease 2\n\n### BRS Gross Examination 2\n\n### BRS Histology 2\n\n### BRS Pediatric 2\n\n### BRS Dermatology 2\n\n### BRS Ophthalmology 2\n\n### BRS Otolaryngology 2\n\n### BRS Surgery 2\n\n### BRS Obstetrics & Gynecology 2\n\n### BRS Preventive Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Psychiatry 2\n\n### BRS Internal Medicine 2\n\n### BRS Neurology 2\n\n### BRS Urology 2\n\n### BRS Pathology 2",
