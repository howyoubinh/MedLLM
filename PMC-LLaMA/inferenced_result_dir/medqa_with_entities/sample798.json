    "question": "A 29-year-old G1P0 female presents at 22 weeks gestation for her first prenatal care appointment. Physical exam demonstrates a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen. Ultrasound examination of the fetus reveals 2.5 L of amniotic fluid (normal 1.5-2.0 L) with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 (normal AFI 20-25). Which of the following fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions could have contributed to these abnormal ultrasound findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Renal agenesis",
      "B": "Pulmonary hypoplasia",
      "C": "Duodenal atresia",
      "D": "Posterior urethral valve"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is likely experiencing complications of maternal diabetes mellitus. Maternal diabetes mellitus can lead to fetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios, and renal agenesis. The fetus may also be at risk for hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia. The excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) may be due to fetal swallowing of excessive amniotic fluid secondary to delayed maturation of the fetal gut. The excessive amniotic fluid may also be due to delayed maturation of the fetal lungs in a fetus that is experiencing placental insufficiency. Duodenal atresia and posterior urethral valves are not associated with excessive amniotic fluid.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
