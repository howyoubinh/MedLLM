    "question": "A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of drowsiness at work for the past several months. He finds his work as a computer programmer rewarding and looks forward to coming into the office every day. However, he often falls asleep during meetings even though he usually gets a good night sleep and has limited his exposure to alcohol and caffeine in the evening. His past medical history is noncontributory. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient’s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Methylphenidate",
      "B": "Sodium oxybate",
      "C": "Imipramine",
      "D": "Increase daytime naps"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has narcolepsy. The mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is diagnostic. Narcolepsy is a disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden weakness triggered by emotions), sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Narcolepsy is thought to be caused by a deficiency of hypocretin, a neurotransmitter produced in the hypothalamus. Methylphenidate and modafinil are stimulants that are commonly used to treat narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate is a medication that is effective in treating cataplexy. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression and may be helpful in treating the sleep paralysis and hallucinations. Increasing daytime naps may help reduce daytime sleepiness but will not treat the underlying condition.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
