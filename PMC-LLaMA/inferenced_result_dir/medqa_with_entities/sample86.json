    "question": "A previously healthy 30-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of pain during sexual intercourse for 6 months. She also reports frequent episodes of crampy pelvic pain that starts one day before menses and lasts for 7 days. Her symptoms are not relieved with pain medication. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband. She uses a combined oral contraceptive pill. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows rectovaginal tenderness. Cervical and urethral swabs are negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Measurement of CA-125 levels",
      "B": "Hysterectomy",
      "C": "Laparoscopy",
      "D": "Hysteroscopy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's history suggests endometriosis. The most appropriate next step in management is laparoscopy. This procedure allows direct visualization of the pelvic organs and allows biopsy or removal of lesions suspected of being endometriosis. Hysterectomy would be too aggressive for a young woman without completing her childbearing years. Hysteroscopy is used to visualize the uterus and would not be helpful in this case. CA-125 levels are not specific for endometriosis and would not be helpful in this case.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
