    "question": "An 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of fever and a pruritic rash that started on his trunk and then progressed to his face and extremities. He has not received any childhood vaccinations because his parents believe that they are dangerous. His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F). A photograph of the rash is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nonbullous impetigo",
      "B": "Varicella",
      "C": "Rubella",
      "D": "Erythema infectiosum"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The photograph shows a generalized pink-to-red maculopapular rash with some clear vesicles on the trunk and extremities. The most likely diagnosis is erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, which is caused by human parvovirus B19. Nonbullous impetigo (staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome) is unlikely because it is characterized by a fiery-red rash that shears off with lateral pressure. Varicella (chickenpox) is unlikely because the rash of varicella is characterized by crops of fluid-filled vesicles that are usually quite pruritic. Rubella (German measles) is unlikely because the rash of rubella is characterized by a pink, blanching, morbilliform rash that usually starts on the face and then spreads to the trunk and extremities.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
