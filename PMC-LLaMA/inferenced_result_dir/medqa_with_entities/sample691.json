    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit. She wishes to become pregnant within the next several months. A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Improved PKU treatment will decrease the risks of spontaneous abortion and intrauterine fetal death",
      "B": "3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL",
      "C": "Begin a phenylalanine-restricted diet in your first trimester to reduce the risk of fetal morbidity",
      "D": "Your current phenylalanine levels do not pose a risk to any future pregnancy"
    }
