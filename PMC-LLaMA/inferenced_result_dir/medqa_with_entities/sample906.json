    "question": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of intermittent chest pain and palpitations. She also complains of dyspnea on exertion and has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months despite normal appetite. She has no history of serious medical illness. Cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm and a grade 3/6, low pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex. Diffuse wheezing and bilateral rales are present in the lung bases. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a mass in the left atrium. A biopsy of the mass is likely to show which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nonencapsulated groups of well-differentiated skeletal muscle cells",
      "B": "Mixture of cells from different germinal layers",
      "C": "Encapsulated cluster of mature fat cells",
      "D": "Nests of atypical melanocytes"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of a left-atrial mass in this patient with intermittent chest pain and palpitations who also has dyspnea on exertion and weight loss is consistent with a diagnosis of atrial myxoma. This is the most common primary cardiac neoplasm, and it is most often found in the left atrium. The tumor is generally attached by a pedicle to the atrial wall, and it can lead to obstruction of the mitral valve orifice. Histologically, the tumor is composed of stellate or globular myxoma (lepidic cell) cells set in a background of myxoid stroma. The lesion is often surrounded by fibrous tissue, sometimes with giant cells and xanthomatous changes.\n\nThe other choices are not likely to be found in a myxoma. An encapsulated cluster of mature fat cells would be a lipoma. Nonencapsulated groups of well-differentiated skeletal muscle cells would be a leiomyoma. An encapsulated cluster of malignant melanocytes would be a malignant melanoma. A mixture of cells from different germinal layers would be a teratoma.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
