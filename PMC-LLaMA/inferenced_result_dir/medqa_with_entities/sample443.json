    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presents to a physician with painful ankles for 2 days. Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40℃ (104℉)) for 3 days. When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5℃ (99.5℉); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Laboratory studies show the following:\nLaboratory test\nHemoglobin 11.4 g/d\nMean corpuscular volume 90 µm3\nLeukocyte count 4,500/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 70%\nLymphocytes 15%\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nRing-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient’s illness?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Babesia babesia",
      "B": "Chikungunya virus",
      "C": "Dengue virus",
      "D": "Leishmania major"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of dengue. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral illness that is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting, eye pain, and rash. The rash that develops in dengue is typically a maculopapular rash that begins on the trunk and spreads to the extremities and face. The illness typically lasts for 5 to 7 days. The diagnosis is made by isolating the virus from patient serum or by detecting IgM antibodies to the virus. Intravascular hemolysis is a hallmark of the disease. The treatment is supportive. Babesiosis is an RBC infection that is transmitted by ticks. The symptoms are similar to malaria, but the rash is not a feature of the disease. Chikungunya virus causes an acute illness characterized by high fever, severe arthralgias, and a maculopapular rash. The arthralgias are often debilitating and can persist for weeks to months. Leishmania major causes a chronic illness characterized by ulcerating lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. The lesions are typically ulcerated and are secondary to an initial inflammatory response followed by a granulomatous response.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
