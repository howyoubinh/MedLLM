    "question": "A study is conducted to determine the most effective ways to prevent transmission of various infective agents. One of the agents studied is a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The investigator determines that inactivating this virus can prevent its spread. Which of the following disinfectants is most likely to inactivate this virus?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chlorhexidine",
      "B": "Sodium hypochlorite",
      "C": "Sulfuric acid",
      "D": "Ethyl alcohol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'A': 'Chlorhexidine', 'B': 'Sodium hypochlorite', 'C': 'Sulfuric acid', 'D': 'Ethyl alcohol'}[?] Chlorhexidine is effective against a wide range of viruses including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and enteroviruses. Sodium hypochlorite is also effective against hepatitis A, B, and enteroviruses, as well as against HIV. Sulfuric acid has no effect on viruses. Ethyl alcohol is effective against some enveloped viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis B, but not against picornaviruses. Glycerol is used to preserve samples of hepatitis B virus. Isopropyl alcohol is used to preserve samples of enteroviruses.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
