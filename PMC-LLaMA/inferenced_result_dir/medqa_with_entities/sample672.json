    "question": "A 6-week-old girl is brought to the pediatrician for a post-natal visit. She was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 25-year-old woman via an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother reports that prenatal screening revealed no developmental abnormalities and that the baby has been gaining weight, feeding, stooling, and urinating appropriately. Physical exam of the infant is unremarkable. The mother has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is curious about the development of her daughter's ovaries. Which of the following is true regarding the baby’s reproductive system at this time?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The baby has not yet developed oocytes",
      "B": "The baby’s oocytes are arrested in prophase",
      "C": "The baby’s oocytes are arrested in interphase",
      "D": "The baby’s oocytes are fully matured"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The baby’s oocytes are arrested in prophase.\n\nThe baby’s ovaries contain primordial follicles, but the oocytes within the primordial follicles are arrested in prophase. They will remain in this stage until puberty, when follicular development resumes. At this time, the oocytes enter meiosis and the first polar body is released. The first polar body can be seen with a light microscope. The first polar body may be released before birth, but the second polar body is not released until ovulation occurs, typically at puberty.\n\nThe baby has not yet developed oocytes.\n\nThe baby’s oocytes are not yet developed at this time. Oogenesis, the development of ova, begins in the fetus at 10 to 12 weeks gestation. At this time, the ovaries contain primordial follicles, but the oocytes within the primordial follicles are arrested in prophase. They will remain in this stage until puberty, when follicular development resumes.\n\nThe baby’s oocytes are arrested in interphase.\n\nThe baby’s oocytes are not yet developed at this time. Oogenesis, the development of ova, begins in the fetus at 10 to 12 weeks gestation. At this time, the ovaries contain primordial follicles, but the oocytes within the primordial follicles are arrested in prophase.
