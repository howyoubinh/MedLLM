    "question": "A 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease becomes acutely anemic in the setting of underlying infection. Her mother denies any previous history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past. The patient’s past medical history is significant for a few episodes of acute pain crisis and a need for splenectomy 3 years ago. The vital signs upon arrival include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 106/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min and regular, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and fingernails are pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 91% on room air and electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia. A blood transfusion is initiated. Shortly after the transfusion has begun, the patient experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the intravenous (IV) site, and sudden hypotension. What is the name of this reaction, and what is the best treatment?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nonhemolytic febrile reaction; administer antihistamines",
      "B": "Minor allergic reaction; discontinue transfusion",
      "C": "Hemolytic transfusion reaction; administer antihistamines",
      "D": "Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The symptoms described are consistent with a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR). This is a common complication of transfusion and is characterized by fever, chills, and muscle pain. It is caused by cytokine release from leukocytes in the donor blood. Treatment is supportive, with acetaminophen and possibly antihistamines. The transfusion should not be discontinued.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
