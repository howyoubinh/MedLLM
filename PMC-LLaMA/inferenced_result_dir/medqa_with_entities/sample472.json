    "question": "A researcher is testing an unknown compound, X, and seeing the effect it has on renal function. When she applies compound X to the cells, she finds that the urinary concentration of sodium and the pH decreases while the urinary potassium increases. Which of the following correctly states:\n1) the cells of the kidney this compound acts on and\n2) the identity of compound X?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Distal convoluted tubule; atrial natriuretic peptide",
      "B": "Distal convoluted tubule; hydrochlorothiazide",
      "C": "Principal cells; aldosterone",
      "D": "Principal cells; spironolactone"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The principal cells of the collecting duct are the site of action of aldosterone. Aldosterone increases the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which causes an increase in sodium reabsorption. This results in an increase in the sodium concentration in the urine, which in turn causes an increase in the reabsorption of water. The net result is a concentrated urine and an increase in extracellular fluid volume. Spironolactone is a competitive antagonist of aldosterone and, therefore, will block the action of aldosterone. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that inhibits the Na+/Cl- sympoer in the distal convoluted tubule. This results in an increase in sodium and chloride in the urine, which leads to a decrease in extracellular fluid volume. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone released by the atria of the heart when the atrial pressure increases. ANP increases the excretion of sodium and water by increasing glomerular filtration while inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal convoluted tubule.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
