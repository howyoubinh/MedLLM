    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Over the past 8 months, his mother reports difficulty understanding the boy's speech. On occasion during this period, she has noticed that he does not respond when called by name and cannot follow 1-step instructions. He has a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth. He is at the 60th percentile for length and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. His speech is quiet and difficult to understand. Otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy. Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss of 26 dB on the right side and 28 dB on the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Adenoidectomy",
      "B": "Tympanostomy tube insertion",
      "C": "Antihistamine therapy",
      "D": "Corticosteroid therapy\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The child's history of chronic ear infections, conductive hearing loss, and immobile tympanic membranes suggest that he has otitis media with effusion (OME) with adenoid hypertrophy. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform an adenoidectomy. Antihistamine therapy and corticosteroid therapy are not indicated in the management of OME. Tympanostomy tube insertion is an option for children with OME who fail medical management and have significant hearing loss. However, in this case, the child's hearing loss is mild and medical management (ie, another round of antibiotics) is not indicated.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
