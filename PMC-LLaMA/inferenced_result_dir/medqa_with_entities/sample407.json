    "question": "A 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension presents to an outpatient office for regular check-up and is found to have hypertriglyceridemia. Her physician prescribes high-dose niacin and recommends taking the medication along with aspirin. The side effect the physician is trying to avoid is thought to be mediated by what mechanism?",

  "model_response": "Niacin is a medication that is often used to treat hypertriglyceridemia. One of the side effects of niacin is that it can cause an intense flushing sensation in the skin. This is thought to be mediated by the release of prostaglandins. Niacin is not typically combined with aspirin for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that is used to prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
