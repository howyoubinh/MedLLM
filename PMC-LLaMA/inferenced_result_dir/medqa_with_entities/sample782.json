    "question": "A 25-year-old primigravida is admitted to the hospital at 36 weeks gestation after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She is conscious, but lethargic and complains of a headache that started 2 hours prior to the seizure. She denies alcohol intake or drug use. She has no history of convulsive disorders and the antepartum course has been unremarkable. She was compliant with the recommended prenatal care and her last prenatal visit was 2 weeks ago. She has gained 2 kg (4.4 lb) since her last visit. The blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the heart rate was 79/min, the respiratory rate was 14/min, and the temperature was 37.0℃ (98.6℉). The physical examination shows leg and perineal edema. The neurologic examination is significant for symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia and ankle clonus. Which of the following laboratory findings would be most common in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Elevated transaminases",
      "B": "Leukocytosis",
      "C": "Hyponatremia",
      "D": "Proteinuria"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a multisystem, hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. It is defined as new-onset hypertension with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg after 20 weeks of gestation and proteinuria ≥ 300 mg/24 h after the 20th week of gestation or proteinuria diagnosed by protein creatinine ratio > 0.3 or urine protein:creatinine ratio > 0.3. The most common cause of seizures in a pregnant patient is eclampsia, which is defined as new-onset grand mal seizures in a patient with preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is associated with hepatic abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary edema, cerebral and visual disturbances, and renal dysfunction. The most common abnormal laboratory finding is an elevated blood pressure. Other common laboratory findings include abnormalities of renal function, such as an elevated creatinine level, elevated transaminase levels, and thrombocytopenia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
