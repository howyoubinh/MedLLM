    "question": "A 3-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a ‘cough-like-a-seal bark’ and a high-pitched inspiratory noise that is audible without a stethoscope. His mother reports that his cough has worsened over the last few hours. The patient's blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate is 35/min, and temperature is 38.3°C (101.1°F). On physical examination, the boy is sitting and leaning forward in apparent respiratory distress with suprasternal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals inspiratory stridor without wheezing. He has a frequent barking cough and a hoarse voice when he speaks. What is a chest X-ray likely to show?",
