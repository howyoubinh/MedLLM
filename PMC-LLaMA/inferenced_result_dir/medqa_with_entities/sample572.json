    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents with a red rash over his face for the last 3 months. The patient says he moved to Nevada 6 months ago because of a new job where he works outdoors; however, he worked indoors in an office before. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, pulse 64/min, respiratory rate 18/min. The patient’s rash is shown in the exhibit. Which of the following is the best initial step in the treatment of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Oral tetracycline",
      "B": "Oral clonidine",
      "C": "Topical metronidazole",
      "D": "Topical benzoyl peroxide"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s rash is consistent with rosacea. The etiology of rosacea is unknown, but it is associated with flushing and telangiectasias in the facial skin. It may progress to papules and pustules, as seen in this patient. The diagnosis is based on the clinical appearance of the rash. There is no specific laboratory test or microscopic examination that establishes the diagnosis. The disease is more common in women, but this patient is not currently taking any medications. Topical metronidazole is the best initial treatment for this patient. Topical tetracycline and doxycycline are also effective. Topical benzoyl peroxide is also used, but it may be irritating to the skin. Oral clonidine is used primarily for the treatment of acne, not rosacea. Oral isotretinoin is used for severe acne, not for rosacea.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
