    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to the office for a routine examination. She has no complaints and offers very little information voluntarily. She answers each question with soft, short sentences and avoids eye contact. She appears timid, anxious and admits that this is one of the very few times she has left the house in the last several years. Medical history is significant for essential hypertension. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings. Despite this, she expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship. Today, her blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 95/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, her heart has a regular rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Which of the following is most consistent with her behavior?",

  "model_response": "{'A': 'Schizoid personality disorder', 'B': 'Avoidant personality disorder', 'C': 'Antisocial personality disorder', 'D': 'Agoraphobia'}[?] Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation or rejection. This pattern of behavior begins in childhood or adolescence and continues into adulthood. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder usually have a strong desire for intimate relationships but avoid them due to their fear of rejection. They tend to be very shy and have few friends. They may be so shy, in fact, that they have few social contacts outside their immediate family. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings. Despite this, she expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship. This is consistent with avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder are emotionally cold and aloof. They appear detached from social relationships and have little desire for close relationships. They prefer solitary intellectual activities. In contrast to the patient in the question, individuals with schizoid personality disorder do not express a strong desire for intimate relationships. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder are often referred to as \"sociopaths\". They are characterized by a disregard for and violation of the rights of others. They are impulsive and have a history of engaging in criminal and/or impulsive behavior. They often display a lack of remorse for their actions. Agoraphobia is an example of an anxiety disorder. It is characterized by an irrational fear of open spaces or places where the individual feels trapped. Individuals with agoraphobia often have a history of avoiding situations such as crowds, public places, being outside alone, or using public transportation. They may become extremely distressed if they find themselves in an open space and may experience panic attacks. KEY CONCEPT: Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation or rejection. This pattern of behavior begins in childhood or adolescence and continues into adulthood. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder usually have a strong desire for intimate relationships but avoid them due to their fear of rejection. They tend to be very shy and have few friends. They may be so shy, in fact, that they have few social contacts outside their immediate family. }</s><s>",
