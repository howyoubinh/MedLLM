    "question": "A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision where he was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, he is unconscious. His respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg, and pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is negative. An electrocardiogram shows absent p-waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cardiac contusion",
      "B": "Hemothorax",
      "C": "Aortic dissection",
      "D": "Pulmonary contusion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most common cause of death after blunt trauma to the chest is cardiac contusion. Cardiac contusion is usually associated with other thoracic injuries, such as pulmonary contusion, hemothorax, and fractured ribs. The presence of a cardiac contusion is usually not recognized during the initial evaluation of a patient with blunt chest trauma. The patient may have chest pain and dyspnea unresponsive to standard therapy. Cardiac markers may be helpful in making the diagnosis, but do not always correlate with the severity of the injury. The ECG may show ST-segment elevations or depressions, or T-wave inversions. Cardiac contusion is usually treated with observation and, if necessary, diuresis. Occasionally, a patient will develop cardiac tamponade, which requires prompt pericardiocentesis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
