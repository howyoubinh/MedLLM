    "question": "A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 32 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department for clear vaginal discharge that started roughly 26 hours ago. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of any serious illnesses. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer ampicillin and perform amnioinfusion",
      "B": "Administer ampicillin and progesterone",
      "C": "Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section",
      "D": "Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has premature rupture of membranes (PROM) at 32 weeks' gestation without evidence of chorioamnionitis. The initial management of this condition includes administration of antenatal steroids, antibiotics, and possibly amnioinfusion. The use of progesterone is controversial. Indomethacin is used to close the ductus arteriosus in fetuses with PROM before 34 weeks' gestation. The patient should be placed on bed rest with frequent vital signs and fetal heart rate monitoring. She should be instructed to return immediately if she develops any fever, leukocytosis, or abdominal pain.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
