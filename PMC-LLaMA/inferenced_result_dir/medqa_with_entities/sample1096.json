    "question": "A 7-year-old woman presents shortly after her birthday with red scaly plaques over both ears. Her mother reports that the patient recently received a pair of fashionable silver earrings from her older sister as a birthday present. Physical examination is only significant for erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears bilaterally. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 121/73 mm Hg, heart rate of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 21/min. Her medical history is non-significant. Of the following options, which is the mechanism of this reaction?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Type I–anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction",
      "B": "Type III–immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction",
      "C": "Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction",
      "D": "Type III and IV–mixed immune complex and cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'A': 'Correct. The patient experienced an immediate type I hypersensitivity reaction to the earrings. Type I reactions are IgE-mediated and occur within minutes to hours after exposure to the antigen.', 'B': 'Incorrect. Type III reactions are immune complex-mediated and do not involve IgE. They typically occur 6 to 21 days after exposure to the antigen.', 'C': 'Incorrect. Type IV reactions are cell-mediated and are usually delayed, occurring hours to days after exposure to the antigen.', 'D': 'Incorrect. Type III and IV reactions are not mixed. They are mutually exclusive. Type III reactions are immune complex-mediated and involve IgG or IgM. Type IV reactions are cell-mediated and involve T lymphocytes. Type I reactions are immediate, involving IgE. Type II reactions are antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and do not involve IgE or IgG/IgM. Type II reactions occur within minutes to hours after exposure to the antigen. Type V reactions are drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia and do not involve IgE, IgG/IgM, or T lymphocytes. They occur days to weeks after exposure to the drug.'}</s><s>",
