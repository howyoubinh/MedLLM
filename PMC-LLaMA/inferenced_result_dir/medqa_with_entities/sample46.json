    "question": "A medical research study is evaluating an investigational novel drug (medication 1) compared with standard therapy (medication 2) in patients presenting to the emergency department with myocardial infarction (MI). The study enrolled a total of 3,000 subjects, 1,500 in each study arm. Follow-up was conducted at 45 days post-MI. The following are the results of the trial:\nEndpoints Medication 1 Medication 2 P-Value\nPrimary: death from cardiac causes 134 210 0.03\nSecondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4\nWhat is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)",

      "A": "5",
      "B": "16",
      "C": "20",
      "D": "50"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The NNT is calculated as 1 divided by the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference in outcome rates between the two groups (death from cardiac causes) divided by the smaller of the two groups. In this case, the ARR is 80 (210 - 134) and the larger group size is 1,500, so the NNT is 1 divided by 80 divided by 1,500, which equals 5.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
