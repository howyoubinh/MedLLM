    "question": "A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of altered mental status. He was found on the floor in front of his apartment. He is somnolent but responsive when aroused. His pulse is 64/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, an alcoholic smell and slurred speech are noted. Neurological exam shows diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and an ataxic gait. His pupils are normal. Blood alcohol concentration is 0.04%. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypoglycemia",
      "B": "Ethanol intoxication",
      "C": "Cannabis intoxication",
      "D": "Benzodiazepine intoxication\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Hypoglycemia is a medical emergency that can present with altered mental status, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and even seizures. The patient's diaphoresis and ataxic gait are consistent with alcohol intoxication. The patient's blood alcohol concentration is below the legal intoxication level in most states (0.08%). However, the nervous system is sensitive to ethanol at lower concentrations, and the depressant effects can be seen even at blood levels as low as 0.04%. Benzodiazepine intoxication can cause altered mental status, but the patient's reflexes are usually brisk, and pupils are usually small. Cannabis intoxication can cause euphoria, but it does not usually cause altered mental status or ataxia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
