    "question": "A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath. He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume",
      "B": "Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume",
      "C": "Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume",
      "D": "Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has emphysema, which is characterized by destruction of the alveolar septa. This causes decreased elastic recoil and increased compliance of the lungs. The increased compliance causes the lung to be held open at the end of expiration by the opposing recoil of the chest wall. This results in an increased residual volume. The increased residual volume accounts for the increased chest diameter. The increased compliance also causes the lung to be less efficient at transmitting force to the airway, so less force is generated at the mouth. This causes a decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume. The residual volume is increased so option A is incorrect. The 1 second forced expiratory volume is decreased so option B is incorrect.\n\n'C' is the correct answer.\n\n'D' is incorrect because the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is decreased.\n\n'E' is incorrect because the vital capacity is decreased.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
