    "question": "A chronic opioid abuser undergoes emergency surgery. Following the operation, the man is started on a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) thought to be dosed adequately to control his pain in the face of his opioid tolerance. He reports intense pain 6 hours after the conclusion of the surgery. Which agent could have been given intraoperatively to reduce this patient's risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ketamine",
      "B": "Midazolam",
      "C": "Propofol",
      "D": "Etomidate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient described in the question has developed a phenomenon known as postoperative hyperalgesia, which is characterized by increased pain sensitivity following surgery. The development of postoperative hyperalgesia is due to a number of factors, including the surgical procedure itself, inflammation, and opioid tolerance. The use of opioids for analgesia in this patient would be expected to provide poor pain control due to the patient's tolerance. The use of ketamine intraoperatively would be expected to reduce the patient's risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia due to its effects on NMDA receptors.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
