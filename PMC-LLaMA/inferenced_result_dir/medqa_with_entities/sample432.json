    "question": "A 54-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her brother for confusion and agitation. She is unable to personally give a history. Her brother says she has a problem with alcohol use and that he found an empty bottle of vodka on the counter at her home. She appears disheveled. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/95 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is confused and oriented only to person. She recalls 0 out of 3 words after 5 minutes. She cannot perform serial sevens and is unable to repeat seven digits forward and five in reverse sequence. Neurologic examination shows horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze. She has difficulty walking without assistance. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 110 μm3\nPlatelet count 280,000/mm3\nWhich of the following is most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Intravenous thiamine",
      "B": "Oral naltrexone",
      "C": "Intravenous vitamin B12",
      "D": "Intravenous glucose\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 110 μm3 (normal 80-96 μm3). The patient's presentation is consistent with Wernicke encephalopathy, which is a result of thiamine deficiency. Thiamine deficiency is most commonly seen in patients with chronic alcoholism. The treatment of choice for Wernicke encephalopathy is intravenous thiamine. If there is accompanying cardiac dysfunction, then intravenous hydroxycobalamin and/or intravenous folic acid also may be given. Naltrexone is an oral opioid antagonist used in the treatment of alcoholism. Vitamin B12 deficiency does not cause Wernicke encephalopathy. The patient's hemoglobin is 11 g/dL, which is below the normal of 12.0-16.0 g/dL for women. A hemoglobin of 11 g/dL does not require treatment. The patient's platelet count of 280,000/mm3 is above the normal of 150,000-400,000/mm3.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
