    "question": "A 42-year-old chronic alcoholic man was admitted to the hospital for inappropriate behavior and disturbed memory. He presents with severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation. Neurologic examination showed horizontal nystagmus. He also has bilateral pretibial pitting edema and perioral erythema. CT studies of the brain were normal. The duty physician suspects the patient may be vitamin deficient. Which of the following reactions does the deficient vitamin mediate?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH",
      "B": "Succinate + FAD (enzyme bound) <=> Fumarate + FADH2",
      "C": "Isocitrate + NAD+ <=> Alpha-Ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH",
      "D": "Succinyl-CoA + Pi + GDP <=> Succinate + GTP + CoA"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is due to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine is a cofactor for enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway. The enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle are: a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, and malate dehydrogenase. The enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The other vitamins listed are not involved in these reactions.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
