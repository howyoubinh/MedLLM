    "question": "A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found unconscious in his apartment by his mother. On arrival, he is unable to provide history. The mother reports that there is no history of serious illness in the family. The patient appears drowsy and dehydrated. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on his forearms and large contusions over his forehead, legs, and back. There is blood coming from the mouth. The patient is catheterized and tea-colored urine is drained. Urinalysis shows:\nUrine\npH 5.8\nSpecific gravity 1.045\nBlood 3+\nGlucose 3+\nProteins 1+\nKetones 1+\nRBC none\nWBC 0-1/hpf\nUrine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine. Intravenous fluids and sodium nitroprusside drip are started. The patient is most likely to have which of the following?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Low serum potassium",
      "B": "Low blood urea nitrogen",
      "C": "Elevated serum calcium",
      "D": "Elevated serum creatine kinase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is in drug overdose with rhabdomyolysis. The laboratory findings of the urine are consistent with myoglobinuria. The intravenous fluids and sodium nitroprusside drip are to allete any potential CHF. The patient is at risk for hyperkalemia due to the rhabdomyolysis. The release of intracellular potassium from the damaged muscle cells can lead to hyperkalemia. The creatine kinase (CK) level will be elevated due to the rhabdomyolysis. The CK level will peak within 24 hours of the muscle injury and remain elevated for 3-5 days. The BUN is usually normal or slightly elevated due to dehydration. The serum calcium level is usually normal or slightly decreased due to the dehydration.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
