    "question": "On routine screening, a 62-year-old man is found to have positive fecal occult blood tests. He is asymptomatic, but his father died of large intestinal cancer. Abdominal and rectal exams are normal. A colonoscopy subsequently reveals a polyp in the descending colon but no other abnormalities. Excisional biopsy of the polyp shows 75% tubular architecture. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inflammatory polyp",

  "model_response": "The lesion is a tubular adenomatous polyp, which has a 3% risk of becoming a cancer. These lesions are often pedunculated and have a lobulated appearance. They tend to be smaller than sessile adenomas.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
