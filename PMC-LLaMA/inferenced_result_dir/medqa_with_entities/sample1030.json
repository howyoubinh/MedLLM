    "question": "A 3466-g (7-lb, 10-oz) female newborn is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 7 and 8, at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother has a history of schizophrenia and was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation, when she found out that she was pregnant. The mother was treated for alcohol abuse disorder 2 years ago. She has been sober for 14 months now. Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum",
      "B": "Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray",
      "C": "Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies",
      "D": "Bilateral cataracts on ocular examination"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This infant has the characteristic features of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The FAS is the most common cause of mental retardation in the United States. The diagnosis is based on the history of maternal alcohol abuse and the presence of at least two of the following findings: growth restriction, microcephaly, a pattern of facial anomalies including micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears, and congenital heart disease. Congenital heart defects are seen in 30% to 50% of children with FAS. The most common anomaly is a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart giving rise to a double bubble sign on x-ray. Neurologic findings include hypoplastic or dysplastic brain, delayed and/or impaired development, and behavioral disturbances. There are no laboratory findings that are specific for FAS. A chromosome 5p deletion is seen in the cri du chat (or 5p minus) syndrome. Cataracts are seen in galactosemia, not FAS. Maternal diabetes can lead to a number of anomalies, including heart defects, but not the constellation seen in this infant.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
