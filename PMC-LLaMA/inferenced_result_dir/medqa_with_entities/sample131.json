    "question": "A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and progressive perioral numbness for the past 24 hours. 3 days ago, he underwent a total thyroidectomy for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. His only medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes a spasm in the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. Which of the following ECG findings are most likely in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Torsade de pointes",
      "B": "QT prolongation",
      "C": "Peaked T waves",
      "D": "PR prolongation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with hypocalcemia, which can occur following thyroid surgery due to damage to the parathyroid glands. QT prolongation is a common ECG finding in hypocalcemia. Torsade de pointes is a specific form of ventricular tachycardia that occurs in patients with a prolonged QT interval. Peaked T waves and PR prolongation are ECG findings associated with hypercalcemia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
