    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

      "A": "Bipolar I disorder",
      "B": "Cyclothymic disorder",
      "C": "Persistent depressive disorder",

    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's history of distinct episodes of mood disturbance lasting several weeks and not clearly linked to any specific stressor is suggestive of a mood disorder. The presence of both depressive and manic episodes suggests a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The depressive episodes are characterized by low mood, sleep disturbances, and appetite disturbance. During the manic episodes, the patient is very productive and requires less sleep than usual. The patient's medical history is significant for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. These medical conditions are not directly related to the mood disorder.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
