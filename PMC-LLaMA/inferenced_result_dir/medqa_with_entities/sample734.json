    "question": "A 10-year-old girl is brought to a clinic by her parents after 1 week of difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers. She has also developed shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth. There is no history of chills, rigors, or headaches. Her appetite has decreased. The girl has been HIV-positive since birth and is being treated with HAART. Her baseline viral load is <50/mL. On general examination, the girl appears ill. Diffuse inspiratory crackles are heard on chest auscultation with normal heart sounds. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly is noted on physical examination. A blood sample is drawn, which shows a CD4 count of 100/mm3 and a viral load of 25,050/mL. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity",
      "B": "env gene mutation",
      "C": "pol gene mutation",
      "D": "Decreased viral replication"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs is an increasingly common problem with the use of HAART. Resistance is most commonly due to mutations in the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which can be detected by PCR. Resistance mutations can also occur in the viral protease and env genes. The development of resistance to multiple drugs necessitates the use of complicated drug regimens. The patient in the question likely has a resistant form of HIV and therefore her symptoms are not due to the HAART therapy. The most likely cause of her symptoms is a decrease in CD4 count, which predisposes her to opportunistic infections. The lack of CD8 cytotoxicity would not cause a lack of response to HAART. An env gene mutation would not cause a lack of response to HAART. A pol gene mutation would not cause a lack of response to HAART. Decreased viral replication would not cause a lack of response to HAART.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
