    "question": "A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. 90 minutes ago, the patient was found by a neighbor unarousable on the couch with multiple empty bottles of medication on the floor next to her. Social history is significant for alcohol abuse. Physical examination reveals an awake female with a fluctuating level of consciousness, not oriented to time or place. No focal neurologic deficits. Which of the following additional findings would most likely be present in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hallucinations",
      "B": "Irreversibility",
      "C": "Multi-infarct dementia",
      "D": "Normal vital signs"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's altered mental status and the presence of empty pill bottles suggest an overdose of medication. The most common type of medication overdose in the elderly is analgesics. The most common type of analgesic overdose is with acetaminophen. The toxic dose of acetaminophen is 150 mg/kg, or 4 g for an adult female. The antidote for acetaminophen overdose is N-acetylcysteine. The other choices are not associated with acetaminophen overdose.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
