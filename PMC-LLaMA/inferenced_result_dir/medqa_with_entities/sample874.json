    "question": "A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a cough. He states that 2 weeks ago, he had a fever, chills, and a cough, which his primary doctor treated with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and rest. Since then, the patient’s symptoms have resolved with the exception of a chronic cough and a small amount of clear sputum that is occasionally laced with blood. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or chills. The patient is otherwise healthy and is currently taking metformin and albuterol. His temperature is 98.3°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 129/75 mmHg, pulse is 84/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for bilateral clear breath sounds, absence of lymphadenopathy on HEENT exam, and a normal oropharynx. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chest radiograph",
      "B": "D-dimer",
      "C": "Sputum culture",
      "D": "Supportive care"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with a community-acquired pneumonia. The absence of chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever make a more serious diagnosis less likely. The patient’s oxygen saturation is normal, which also suggests a less severe pneumonia. The patient’s age, lack of risk factors, and lack of physical findings make a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism unlikely. Therefore, a chest radiograph is the best next step in management to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
