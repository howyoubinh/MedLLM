    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for her yearly exam. Her only complaint is difficulty losing weight. Her BMI is 34 kg/m^2. In addition to a standard physical exam, the physician orders a glucose tolerance test. The woman's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL and two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL. The physician informs the patient that she is \"pre-diabetic\" or at risk of developing diabetes and recommends lifestyle modification with follow-up in 6 months. Which of the following endogenous signaling molecules or receptors will increase insulin sensitivity in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Catecholamines",
      "B": "Glucagon",
      "C": "Glucocorticoids",
      "D": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The answer is not as clear-cut as one might think. Catecholamines, glucagon, glucocorticoids, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) receptors are all involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. Catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, stimulate the activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) receptors. PPARg receptors are found in adipose tissue and play a role in regulating the activity of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Activation of PPARg receptors promotes the differentiation of fibroblast into adipocytes and enhances the uptake of glucose by adipose tissue. Activation of PPARg receptors also increases the expression of GLUT4 in muscle and adipose tissue. Activation of PPARg receptors increases insulin sensitivity. Glucagon acts via a GPCR to increase cAMP levels. Increased cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates and inactivates the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC is involved in the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, the first step in fatty acid synthesis. Inhibition of ACC decreases the synthesis of malonyl-CoA and, therefore, decreases the synthesis of fatty acids. In the liver, glucagon also increases glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Increased levels of glucagon increase the release of glucose from the liver, which increases plasma glucose levels. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, also increase insulin resistance. Cortisol binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and acts as a transcription factor. Glucocorticoid receptors increase the expression of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11bHSD-1). 11bHSD-1 inactivates cortisol by converting it to cortisone. Cortisone does not bind to the glucocorticoid receptor and does not have the same insulin-resistant effects as cortisol. In addition, glucocorticoids increase the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and leptin, which also increase insulin resistance. Finally, catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, also increase insulin resistance. Epinephrine binds to b-adrenergic receptors and activates adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase produces cAMP, which activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC is involved in the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, the first step in fatty acid synthesis. Inhibition of ACC decreases the synthesis of malonyl-CoA and, therefore, decreases the synthesis of fatty acids. Epinephrine also increases the breakdown of glycogen via glycogenolysis and the release of glucose into the blood. Epinephrine also increases the breakdown of triacylglycerols stored in adipose tissue, resulting in the release of free fatty acids and glycerol into the blood.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
