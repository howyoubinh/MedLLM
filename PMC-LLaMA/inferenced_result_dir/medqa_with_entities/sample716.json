This morning, she started a course of ceftriaxone for treatment of pyelonephritis. A photograph of the rash is shown. This patient's skin findings are most likely associated with which of the following?",

The rash is due to a nonimmune, direct toxic effect of the drug on the skin. This rash is not an allergic reaction and does not represent a toxic reaction between the drug and some endogenous antigen.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
