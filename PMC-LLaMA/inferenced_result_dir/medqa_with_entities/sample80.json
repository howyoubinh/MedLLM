  "model_response": "The Reid Index is a ratio between the thickness of the granuloma and the thickness of the accompanying fibrosis. It is useful in distinguishing sarcoidosis from other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis and histoplasmosis. The Reid Index is calculated by dividing the thickness of the granuloma (in millimeters) by the thickness of the accompanying fibrosis (in millimeters). The resulting ratio, termed the Reid Index, should be greater than 0.7 in sarcoidosis. In other words, the thickness of the granuloma should be at least 70% of the thickness of the fibrosis.\n\nOption A: Hypereosinophilia is not a characteristic of sarcoidosis.\nOption B: The Reid Index is not a characteristic of sarcoidosis.\nOption C: Non-caseating granulomas are not a characteristic of sarcoidosis.\nOption D: Evidence of a necrotizing infection is not a characteristic of sarcoidosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
