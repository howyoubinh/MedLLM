    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Begin aspirin therapy",
      "B": "Begin clopidogrel",
      "C": "Carotid endarterectomy",
      "D": "Begin warfarin and heparin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ECG shows atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The patient has a history of ischemic stroke, and with the new-onset of AF, the risk of stroke is increased. Anticoagulation is the treatment of choice to prevent future CVAs. Warfarin and heparin are both acceptable choices. Warfarin is often the preferred anticoagulant because it has a stable anticoagulant effect, has a long half-life, and INR monitoring is not required. The half-life of heparin is short, and it requires continuous IV infusion. Aspirin is not indicated in this patient because it has no significant benefit in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with AF. Clopidogrel is also not indicated because it is no more effective than aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke in patients with AF. Carotid endarterectomy is not indicated in this patient because he has already had a stroke in the past month.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
