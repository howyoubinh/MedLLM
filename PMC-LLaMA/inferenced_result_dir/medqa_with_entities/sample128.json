    "question": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.7 g/dL\nLeukocytes 11,200/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h\nSerum\nCreatine kinase 212 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L\nAST 34 U/L\nALT 35 U/L\nWhich of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy",
      "B": "Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy",
      "C": "Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies",
      "D": "Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is D. The clinical and laboratory features are consistent with a myopathy. The family history is suggestive of a genetic muscular dystrophy. The most common form of muscular dystrophy is Duchenne's, an X-linked disorder. The other options are not consistent with the clinical picture. Inflammatory myopathies have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a more acute onset. Endocrine and drug-induced myopathies are unlikely in this middle-aged woman. The various types of muscular dystrophy are distinguished by the pattern of muscle involvement and histology. The most common form is Duchenne's, which shows progressive weakness of the pelvifemoral musculature and is characterized by intrafascicular infiltration of the muscle by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

This agent lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, and modulates immune responses through the suppression of MHC II (major histocompatibility complex II) on interferon gamma-stimulated antigen-presenting cells such as human vascular endothelial cells. Due to its anti-inflammatory effects mediated by alterations of lipid metabolism, fluvastatin may possess chemopreventive and therapeutic antineoplastic properties."
