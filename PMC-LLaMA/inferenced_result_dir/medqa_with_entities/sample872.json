    "question": "An 18-year-old male presents to the emergency department trauma bay with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The patient undergoes an exploratory laparotomy, during which, it is discovered that his splenic artery was damaged at its origin from the celiac trunk. The surgeon ligates the splenic artery at its origin. Which of the following arteries will now be hypoperfused as a result?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Left gastric artery",
      "B": "Gastroduodenal artery",
      "C": "Left gastroepiploic artery",
      "D": "Common hepatic artery"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The splenic artery arises from the celiac trunk, which also gives rise to the left gastric artery. The splenic artery then gives rise to the branches listed in the answer choices. Therefore, if the splenic artery is ligated at its origin, all of these branches will be hypoperfused.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
