    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8℃ (100.0℉) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:\nHemoglobin 9 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 88 μm3\nLeukocyte count 18,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 130,000/mm3\n    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nSerum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L\nAn excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient?",
