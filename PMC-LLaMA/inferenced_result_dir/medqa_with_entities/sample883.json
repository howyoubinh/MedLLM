    "question": "An immunology expert is delivering a talk on innate immunity. While talking about inflammasomes, he describes the process via an example: products of cellular stress are detected by NLRP3, which includes NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3; the latter interacts with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) via the pyrin domain, which leads to the formation of a protein speck that consists of multimers of ASC dimers. Which of the following enzymes will be activated as the next step in the process?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Adenosine deaminase",
      "B": "Caspase 1",
      "C": "Protein phosphatase",
      "D": "Tyrosine kinase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The process described is the formation of an inflammasome, which will activate caspase 1 to generate the biologically active form of IL-1. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that assemble in the cytoplasm in response to a variety of stimuli and activate caspase-1, which cleaves a precursor form of interleukin-1 (IL-1) to generate the biologically active form. The NLRP3 inflammasome, which is expressed in myeloid cells and epithelial cells, consists of the NLRP3 sensor, the adaptor protein ASC, and caspase-1. The other enzymes listed are not involved in this process.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
