    "question": "A 41-year-old man presents to the clinic with the complaints of abdominal discomfort and cramping for the past 4 months. He also mentions that he has grossly bloody stool and most of the time an urge to defecate. He has a history of bulimia with laxative abuse several years ago. He admits having lost about 5 lb in the past month. His temperature is 37° C (98.6° F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 105/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, a mild conjunctival pallor is evident, and the rectum is erythematous, indurated, and tender. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ulcerative colitis",
      "B": "Celiac disease",
      "C": "Irritable bowel syndrome",
      "D": "Crohn’s disease"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A. Ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation and mucosal ulcerations of the colon. Patients present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. The disease typically involves the rectum and extends proximally to involve all or part of the colon. The distal colon is most often affected. Colonoscopy is the best diagnostic test. It reveals continuous mucosal lesions, and biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Crohn’s disease can also present with similar symptoms, but in this case, the distribution of the disease is more consistent with ulcerative colitis. Celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome do not present with bloody stool.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
