    "question": "A 3-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of somnolence, poor feeding, and one episode of vomiting. He is exclusively breastfed. His serum glucose concentration is 88 mg/dL and his serum ammonia concentration is 850 Î¼mol/L (N<90). Urinalysis shows an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio. Urinary ketones are absent. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes which of the following reactions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline",
      "B": "Orotic acid to uridine monophosphate",
      "C": "Pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A",
      "D": "Glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A to N-acetylglutamate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a history of hyperammonemia, and the urinary orotic acid to creatinine ratio is increased. These findings are characteristic of a deficiency of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase, which catalyzes the reaction of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline. This enzyme deficiency is the most common cause of hyperammonemia in the neonatal period. The accumulation of glutamate in the brain leads to somnolence. The other choices are not related to hyperammonemia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
