    "question": "During the normal catabolism of protein, urea and ammonia are produced as waste products. If these waste products are not cleared by the liver and kidneys, hyperammonemia can occur, leading to confusion and delirium. Fortunately, a healthy liver can clear these waste products via the urea cycle. Which of the following reactions is the rate limiting step in this cycle?",
    "options": {
      "A": "NH3 + HCO3- + 2 ATP --> carbamoyl phosphate + 2 ADP + Pi",
      "B": "Carbamoyl phosphate + ornithine --> citrulline+ Pi",
      "C": "Citrulline + aspartate + ATP --> arginosuccinate + AMP + PPi",
      "D": "Arginine + H20 --> ornithine + urea"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The rate limiting step in the urea cycle is the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate. This reaction requires two ATPs, and is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. The enzyme is active only in the presence of N-acetyl glutamate, which is an allosteric activator that enhances the affinity of the synthase for ATP. N-acetyl glutamate is synthesized from acetyl CoA and glutamate in a reaction that requires Mg2+.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
