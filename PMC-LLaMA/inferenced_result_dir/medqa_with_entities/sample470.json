    "question": "A 75-year-old man presents to his physician with a 1-year history of dysphagia for solids. His more recent complaints include dysphagia for liquids as well. The patient states that he has no difficulty initiating swallowing but occasionally food is stuck in his throat. He does not complain of pain while swallowing but has noticed minor unintentional weight loss. The patient has no history of speech-related pain or nasal regurgitation. His family history is unremarkable. During the examination, the patient appears ill, malnourished, and slightly pale. He is not jaundiced nor cyanotic. Physical examination is unremarkable. A swallowing study reveals a small outpouching in the posterior neck (see image). Which nerve is most likely involved in this patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "CN X",
      "B": "CN VII",
      "C": "CN IX",
      "D": "CN V"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are most consistent with a Zenker’s diverticulum, which is an outpouching of the posterior pharyngeal wall through the Killian’s dehiscence, an area between the thyropharyngeus (oblique fibers) and cricopharyngeus (transverse fibers) of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. This is a false diverticulum since it does not include all of the layers of the esophageal wall. Zenker’s diverticulum is usually caused by neuromuscular incoordination in this region, leading to the outpouching. The most common nerve involved is CN X (vagus nerve). This nerve supplies the motor fibers to the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. CN VII (facial nerve) innervates the muscles of facial expression. CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) provides motor fibers to the stylopharyngeus muscle, which is involved in elevation of the pharynx during swallowing. CN V (trigeminal nerve) innervates the muscles of mastication.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
