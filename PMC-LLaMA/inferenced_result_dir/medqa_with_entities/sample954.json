    "question": "A 26-year-old Caucasian woman is admitted to the emergency department after 4 days of fever, malaise, vomiting, and nausea for which she has been taking ibuprofen and diclofenac. She has also noticed a decrease in urination. Her family and past medical history are unremarkable. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.7°F), blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, heart rate is 74/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. Upon physical examination, her mucous membranes are moist and she has no abdominal tenderness. Four hours after admission, she has a urinary output < 0.3 mL/kg/h and laboratory tests significant for the following:\nDifferential blood count\nWhite blood cells 8.1 x 109/L\nNeutrophils 4.8 x 109/L\nLymphocytes 2.1 x 109/L\nEosinophils 0.9 x 109/L\nMonocytes 0.3 x 109/L\nBasophils 0.04 x 109/L\n  Serum creatinine (SCr) 1.9 mg/dL\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN) 25 mg/dL\nNa+ 135 mEq/L\nK+ 5.4 mEq/L\nCl- 106 mEq/L\nUrine dipstick\nUrine density 1.010\npH 6.2\nRed blood cells per field of high power 2\nWBC casts Present\nWhich of the following skin manifestations would you also expect to find in this patient?",
