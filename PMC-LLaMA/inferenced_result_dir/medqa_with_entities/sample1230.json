    "question": "A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. He has a history of constipation. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°C). Abdominal examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3. A CT scan of the abdomen shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels. CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. Release of which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion?",
