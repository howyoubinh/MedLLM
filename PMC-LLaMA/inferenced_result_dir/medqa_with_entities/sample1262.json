    "question": "A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of malaise. Two hours prior to presentation, he developed muscle cramps and nausea. He has had 3 episodes of non-bloody watery stools since his symptoms started. He reports that he has experienced similar symptoms multiple times over the past 5 years since he started working at his local zoo as a reptilian caretaker. His medical history is unremarkable. He takes fish oil and a multivitamin daily. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, he demonstrates sensitivity to bright light. He is tired-appearing but alert and fully oriented. A stool sample and culture demonstrates abundant non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition relies on a virulence factor with which of the following mechanisms of action?",
    "options": {
      "A": "ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2",
      "B": "Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen",
      "C": "Cleaving immunoglobulin A molecules",
      "D": "Cleaving lecithin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has infection with Vibrio cholerae, which is a gram-negative bacterium that causes cholera. Cholera is characterized by the sudden onset of severe watery diarrhea and is associated with a massive secretion of water and electrolytes from the gastrointestinal tract. The toxin responsible for this condition is the cholera toxin, which is composed of an A subunit and a B subunit. The B subunit binds to the enterocyte receptors, while the A subunit ADP ribosylates the Gs protein, resulting in the activation of adenylate cyclase. The subsequent overproduction of cyclic AMP leads to the outpouring of isotonic fluid from the cell. The cholera enterotoxin is structurally and functionally similar to the heat-labile toxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The other toxins listed are not associated with cholera.\n\nBlocking antibody attack on the O antigen (choice B) is a mechanism of action of the capsule of certain bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The capsule prevents phagocytosis by neutrophils. \n\nVibrio cholerae (choice E) does not produce lecithinase. Lecithinase is an enzyme that cleaves lecithin, which is a component of the cell membrane. Bacteria that produce lecithinase include Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus.\n\nDiagnosis: Cholera, Vibrio\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
