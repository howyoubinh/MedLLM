    "question": "A 3-year-old refugee with increasing pitting edema and abdominal swelling over the past 2 months is brought to the physician. Her family has been displaced several times over the last few years. Nutrition and housing were frequently inadequate. At the physician’s clinic, the boy appears irritated and drowsy. He is difficult to arouse. Physical examination shows pitting edema over the ankles and feet and around his eyes. Abdominal examination is positive for ascites and hepatomegaly. Oral examination shows several missing teeth. Which of the following best explains these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Kwashiorkor",
      "B": "Marasmus",
      "C": "Beriberi",
      "D": "Rickets"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings are typical for kwashiorkor, a form of severe protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) that is associated with edema. Marasmus is another form of PEM that is characterized by severe wasting without edema. Beriberi is caused by thiamine deficiency and is most common in areas where polished rice is the major component of the diet. Rickets can be caused by calcium or vitamin D deficiency or by renal osteodystrophy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
