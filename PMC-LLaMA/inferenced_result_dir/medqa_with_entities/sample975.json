    "question": "A 28-year-old man reports to his physician that he is having second thoughts about his long-term compatibility with his wife ever since they relocated to a new city. He admits that he has noticed himself flirting with some of the female co-workers at his new workplace. When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men. The man’s actions are most consistent with which of the following psychological defense mechanisms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Displacement",
      "B": "Dissociation",
      "C": "Projection",
      "D": "Repression"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The man is displaying reaction formation, which is a defense mechanism that involves transforming an impulse into its exact behavioral opposite. In this case, the man is behaving in a flirtatious manner with other women instead of acknowledging his own feelings of attraction to someone other than his wife. This is a form of displacement, which involves redirecting an impulse onto a substitute target. Dissociation involves detaching oneself from reality, and this man is remaining very much grounded in reality by accusing his wife of infidelity. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable impulses or feelings onto someone else, and this man is not projecting his own infidelity onto his wife. Repression involves consciously or unconsciously keeping disturbing thoughts, feelings, or memories out of conscious awareness, and this man is not repressing his own infidelity.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
