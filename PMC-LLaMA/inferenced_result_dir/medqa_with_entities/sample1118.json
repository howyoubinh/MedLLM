    "question": "A 40-year-old obese man with a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease presents with one day of excruciating pain, swelling, and redness in his greater toe. He denies any inciting trauma or similar prior episodes. Vital signs are stable. On examination, the right first toe is grossly erythematous and edematous, with range of motion limited due to pain. Deposition of which of the following is associated with the most likely underlying joint disorder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Calcium phosphate",
      "B": "Calcium oxalate",
      "C": "Monosodium urate",
      "D": "Copper"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This is a case of acute gouty arthritis. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of urate crystals in the synovial fluid of affected joints. Hyperuricemia is present in approximately half of patients with gout. The most common joint involved in gout is the first metatarsophalangeal joint (the great toe). Calcium phosphate crystals are deposited in the joints in cases of calcific periarthritis. Calcium oxalate crystals are deposited in the kidney in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning. Monosodium urate crystals are deposited in the joints in cases of gout. Copper deposits are seen in Wilson disease.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
