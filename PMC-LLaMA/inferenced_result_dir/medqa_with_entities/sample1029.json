    "question": "A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness visit. She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months. She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Elevated TSH",
      "B": "High Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score",
      "C": "Positive anti-CCP antibodies",
      "D": "Positive urine toxicology"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has symptoms of hypothyroidism, including fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and carpal tunnel syndrome (wrist tenderness). The delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes is also consistent with hypothyroidism. The patient has a family history of autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis) and a history of experimentation with LSD, which may increase her risk for autoimmune disease. The PHQ-9 is a screening tool for depression, and a score of 10 or above is considered clinically significant. A high score would not explain the patient's physical exam findings or weight gain. Anti-CCP antibodies are specific for rheumatoid arthritis, but the patient does not have joint pain or swelling. A positive urine toxicology screen would be expected to produce hyperactivity, increased reflexes, and possibly seizures. A positive urine toxicology screen would not explain the patient's physical exam findings or weight gain.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
