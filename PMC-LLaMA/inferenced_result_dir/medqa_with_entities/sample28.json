    "question": "A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Gram stain positive CSF",
      "B": "Peripheral eosinophilia",
      "C": "Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis",
      "D": "Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has HUS. The presence of bloody stools, decreased oral intake of food and water, and weakness and tingling in the lower extremities are all consistent with HUS. The presence of guaiac positive stools also suggests lower gastrointestinal tract involvement. The patient is at risk for CNS complications such as seizures and coma. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may show xanthochromia due to RBC breakdown in the CNS. Peripheral eosinophilia is not a feature of HUS.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
