    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with increasing swelling of his right jaw for the past 2 months. She notes that he has been treated several times with different antibiotics, but that they have not helped. She reports no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. The boy has no significant medical history. He emigrated to the United States with his family from Nigeria 1 month ago. He is in the 85th percentile for height and weight, and he has been meeting all developmental milestones. His temperature is 37.8℃ (100.0℉). On physical examination, the patient has a prominent 8 × 8 cm mass over the right mandible. The mass has partially distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek. The overlying skin is erythematous. The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The contralateral side of the face shows no abnormalities. An oral examination shows the disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A biopsy of the mass is performed and a histopathologic analysis is seen in the image. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bartonella henselae",
      "B": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV)",
      "C": "Epstein barr virus (EBV)",
      "D": "Yersinia pestis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The image shows a lymph node with numerous small abscesses surrounded by epithelioid macrophages. This is consistent with a diagnosis of cat-scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae. The history of a cat scratch and the characteristic clinical and histologic findings make the diagnosis straightforward. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause lymphadenopathy, but the characteristic finding is a large cell containing an owl’s eye appearance. Epstein barr virus (EBV) can cause lymphadenopathy, but the characteristic finding is a large cell containing an owl’s eye appearance. Yersinia pestis can cause lymphadenopathy, but the characteristic finding is a large cell containing an owl’s eye appearance.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Any imprint and/or symbol should be clearly identifiable, and the viewer should not normally need to rotate the image in order to read it. Images that are submitted with SPL should be included in the same directory as the SPL file."
