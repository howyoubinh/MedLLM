    "question": "A 54-year-old man presents with the acute onset of seizures and hallucinations. The patient’s wife says that he had been on a camping trip a few months earlier to study bats but otherwise has not traveled recently. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, managed medically with hydralazine and enalapril. The patient’s condition rapidly deteriorates, and he passes away. An autopsy is performed and a histologic stained section of the brain is shown in the image. Which of the following receptors are targeted by the pathogen most likely responsible for this patient’s condition?",

  "model_response": "The patient’s condition is consistent with a diagnosis of rabies, which is transmitted by the bite of a rabid animal, typically a bat, dog, or fox. The pathogen is the rabies virus, which is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family. The rabies virus is a bullet-shaped, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. The rabies virus infects a wide range of animals, including birds, but most commonly affects carnivorous or omnivorous animals, such as dogs, cats, skunks, foxes, raccoons, and bats. The rabies virus is transmitted from the infected animal to humans typically by a bite, which transmits the virus through saliva. The virus then replicates in striated and/or ganglionic tissue, particularly the salivary glands and the brain. The virus can also be transmitted from the infected animal to humans via contact with its saliva, such as through mucosal surfaces of the eyes, nose, or mouth. Once the virus enters the body, it can disseminate to the central nervous system (CNS) through retrograde neural transmission within the dorsal root ganglia. The rabies virus infects many different cell types, but it has a particular tropism for the neurons of the CNS and the salivary glands. The rabies virus is transmitted from host to host by an infected animal’s biting behavior. The virus replicates in striated muscle tissue and then spreads to the CNS and salivary glands. The virus can also be transmitted trans-placentally from infected animals to their offspring. The rabies virus is a neurotropic virus that replicates in the cytoplasm. The virus attaches to the host cell through the attachment (C) protein on the virus surface. The virus then enters the cell through endocytosis. The virus then uses the viral RNA polymerase to transcribe the viral RNA into mRNA, which is used for translation of viral proteins. The viral nucleocapsid proteins are produced first, followed by the production of the viral matrix proteins. The viral matrix proteins are important for the assembly of the virion. The viral matrix proteins are followed by the production of the viral glycoproteins, which are important for host cell attachment and cell-to-cell fusion. The final viral proteins produced are the viral RNA polymerase and the matrix protein, which are important for viral replication.
