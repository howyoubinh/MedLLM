    "question": "Three days after admission to the intensive care unit for septic shock and bacteremia from a urinary tract infection, a 34-year-old woman has persistent hypotension. Her blood cultures are positive for Escherichia coli, for which she has been receiving appropriate antibiotics since admission. She has no history of any serious illness. She does not use illicit drugs. Current medications include norepinephrine, ceftriaxone, and acetaminophen. She appears well. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate is 96/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. Examination of the back shows costovertebral tenderness bilaterally. Examination of the thyroid gland shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\n  Hospital day 1 Hospital day 3\nLeukocyte count 18,500/mm3 10,300/mm3\nHemoglobin 14.1 mg/dL 13.4 mg/dL\nSerum\nCreatinine 1.4 mg/dL 0.9 mg/dL\nFasting glucose 95 mg/dL 100 mg/dL\nTSH   1.8 µU/mL\nT3, free   0.1 ng/dL\nT4, free   0.9 ng/dL\nRepeat blood cultures are negative. A chest X-ray shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",

The other choices are unlikely to be the cause of the hypotension.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
