    "question": "A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills. The patient’s mother mentions that he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago for which he was taking a medication that resulted in only a slight improvement in his symptoms. She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn’t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely overdose on?",

Bupropion should always be used in combination with a smoking cessation program. Bupropion is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. The elimination half-life is 10 to 14 hours for non-smokers but only 8 hours for smokers. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant that is used in the treatment of major depressive disorder as well as seasonal affective disorder. Bupropion is also used as an aid in smoking cessation. Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant because it acts primarily as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. The most common adverse effects associated with bupropion are insomnia, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, tremor, sweating, and nausea. The use of bupropion has been associated with the development of seizures. The risk of seizures is increased in patients who have a history of seizures or who are taking other medications that lower the seizure threshold. Other adverse effects associated with bupropion include psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, agitation, and confusion. Bupropion can also cause activation of mania or hypomania in patients with an underlying bipolar disorder. Bupropion should be used cautiously in patients with a history of eating disorders or with symptoms of anxiety. Bupropion should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Bupropion should not be taken during pregnancy because it has been shown to increase the risk of congenital malformations.
