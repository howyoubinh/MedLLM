    "question": "A 76-year-old man presents to the physician because of dyspepsia and weight loss over the past 6 months. He has no history of any serious illnesses and takes no medications. A diagnostic workup including endoscopy and biopsy shows gastric adenocarcinoma. Before further workup and staging, the biopsy results are discussed with the patient. He refuses any type of life-prolonging treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery, but he requests appropriate palliative care without any significant burden of healthcare costs. Regarding this patient’s eligibility for hospice care, what is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A trial of life-extending treatment",
      "B": "Determining patient’s life-expectancy without treatment",
      "C": "Establishing the presence of metastasis",
      "D": "No further steps are required because the patient already qualifies for hospice care"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most appropriate next step is to determine patient’s life-expectancy without treatment. Hospice care is a program of care focused on the palliative needs of the terminally ill. It is appropriate when the prognosis is limited, usually defined as a life expectancy of 6 months or less. In this case, the patient has already been diagnosed with incurable gastric adenocarcinoma. The next step is to determine his life expectancy without treatment. If he has metastatic disease, he would be eligible for hospice care. If he does not have metastatic disease, his life expectancy will determine whether he is a candidate for hospice care.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Microscopically, two important histologic types of gastric adenocarcinoma are recognized: the intestinal and diffuse type. The overall prognosis of gastric adenocarcinomas is poor, even in patients who receive a \"curative\" resection (adapted from Sternberg's Surgical Pathology, 3rd ed., 1999)."
