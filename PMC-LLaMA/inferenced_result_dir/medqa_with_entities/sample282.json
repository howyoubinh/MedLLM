    "question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of concerns about her behavior during the past 2 years. She does not have friends and spends most of the time reading by herself. Her father says that she comes up with excuses to avoid family dinners and other social events. She states that she likes reading and feels more comfortable on her own. On mental status examination, her thought process is organized and logical. Her affect is flat. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Schizoid personality disorder",
      "B": "Antisocial personality disorder",
      "C": "Schizophreniform disorder",
      "D": "Autism spectrum disorder"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This girl's behavior is consistent with schizoid personality disorder. People with this disorder do not desire or enjoy close relationships. They prefer solitary intellectual activities. They may appear aloof or detached in social situations. On the other hand, people with autism spectrum disorder have difficulties with social interactions and communication, and they may engage in repetitive behaviors or activities. In this case, the girl's behavior is not consistent with the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
