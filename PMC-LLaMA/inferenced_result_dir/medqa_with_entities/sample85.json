    "question": "A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help. He has been unable to go to work because of his symptoms. The patient has been previously hospitalized for a tricuspid valve replacement surgery 1 year ago and takes aspirin daily. The medical history is also relevant for myocardial infarction 3 years ago and hypertension for the past 10 years, for which he takes lisinopril. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, the respirations are 18/minute, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). On examination, several hemorrhages are noted on the nail beds of several fingers. Which of the following findings would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bicuspid valve",
      "B": "Friable irregular masses attached to the valve",
      "C": "Papillary muscle rupture",
      "D": "Annular calcification"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of papillary muscle rupture would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis of infective endocarditis in this patient. The rupture of a papillary muscle leads to acute mitral regurgitation and can cause acute heart failure with cardiogenic shock. The other choices are not characteristic of infective endocarditis. A bicuspid valve is a congenital anomaly that predisposes the individual to endocarditis, but the finding of friable irregular masses attached to the valve is more characteristic of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), which is usually seen in patients with a hypercoagulable state or a debilitating disease. Annular calcification is a feature of age-related mitral valve degeneration and is not specific for infective endocarditis. Vegetations are the characteristic lesions of infective endocarditis, but the finding of friable irregular masses attached to the valve is more characteristic of NBTE.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
