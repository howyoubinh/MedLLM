    "question": "A 95-year-old woman who is a resident at a long term care facility, got up from her chair, tripped on a rug, and fell on her right knee. She could not get up without assistance and complained of severe pain in her right hip and buttock. The nurse who evaluated her tried to stand her up, but when the patient tried to stand on her right leg, she dropped her left hip and lost her balance. The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn’t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family. Past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. Physical exam confirmed the nurse’s findings. Radiographs proved the presence of a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. What medication is most likely associated with this patient’s confusion?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Metformin",
      "B": "Oxybutynin",
      "C": "Metoprolol",
      "D": "Lisinopril"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This elderly woman suffered a right posterior hip dislocation. Confusion and incontinence are signs of an acute delirium, likely related to her pain and the trauma of the fall. The most likely medication associated with her delirium is metoprolol, a beta-blocker, which can exacerbate delirium in the elderly. Lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and metformin are not known to cause delirium.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
