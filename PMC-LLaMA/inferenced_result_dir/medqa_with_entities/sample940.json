    "question": "A 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presents to your primary care office with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. On exam, you note an elevated JVP and 2+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increase in capillary pressure",
      "B": "Decrease in plasma proteins",
      "C": "Increase in capillary permeability",
      "D": "Increase in interstitial fluid pressure"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's lower extremity edema is due to increased capillary pressure secondary to impaired right ventricular function. Right ventricular dysfunction can lead to right-sided heart failure and subsequent systemic venous congestion. This results in increased capillary pressure and peripheral edema. Decreased plasma proteins, increase in capillary permeability, and increased interstitial fluid pressure are not likely causes of this patient's edema.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
