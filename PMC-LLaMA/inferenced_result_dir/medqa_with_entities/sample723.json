    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a generalized, non-itchy rash for 2 days. He has also had a fever and sore throat for 4 days. He has not received any routine childhood vaccinations. Examination shows a flushed face except around his mouth. A diffuse, papular, erythematous rash that blanches with pressure is seen over the trunk. Pharyngeal erythema and a red beefy tongue are noted. His leukocyte count is 11,200/mm3 (75% segmented neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes). Without treatment, this patient's current condition puts him at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Coronary artery aneurysms",
      "B": "Encephalitis",
      "C": "Mitral valve regurgitation",
      "D": "Minimal change disease"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has Kawasaki disease, which is characterized by fever, rash, conjunctival injection, erythema of the oral cavity, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery aneurysms can develop in up to 25% of untreated patients, usually 1-2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin reduces this risk. Encephalitis and meningitis are uncommon but serious complications. Other uncommon complications include aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, pericarditis, and peripheral vascular insufficiency. The cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown. It is not caused by any known virus.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
