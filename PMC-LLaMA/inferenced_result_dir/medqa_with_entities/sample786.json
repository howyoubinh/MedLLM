    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after falling from the jungle gym and developing severe left knee pain and swelling. On presentation, he is found to be in pain with a hot, swollen, erythematous left knee. His past medical history is significant for abnormal coagulation lab tests before an appendectomy, but his mother cannot recall the exact details. Coagulation tests are conducted with the following results:\n\nBleeding time: 3 minutes\nProthrombin time: 11 seconds\nPartial thromboplastin time: 53 seconds\nBradykinin formation: decreased\n\nWhich of the following factors is most likely defective in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Factor VII",
      "B": "Factor VIII",
      "C": "Factor IX",
      "D": "Factor XII"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A. Factor VII. This patient has a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, which indicates a defect in the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. Factor VII is a part of the extrinsic pathway, so it is not affected by these lab abnormalities. Factor VII is the most common factor deficiency in patients with hemophilia. The other factors listed are involved in the intrinsic and common pathways.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
