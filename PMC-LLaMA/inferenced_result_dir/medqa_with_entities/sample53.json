    "question": "A 72-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter because of a 6-month history of worsening short-term memory deficits and social withdrawal. Treatment with galantamine is initiated. Two weeks later, the patient develops vomiting, mild crampy abdominal pain, and watery, nonbloody diarrhea. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bethanechol",
      "B": "Metoclopramide",
      "C": "Atropine",
      "D": "Oxybutynin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has been diagnosed with drug-induced diarrhea (DID). The most common cause of DID is the use of antimicrobial agents. Other drugs that can cause DID include anticonvulsants, colchicine, lithium, and the 5-HT3 antagonists used to treat nausea and vomiting. The next most common cause of DID is the use of drugs that alter acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmission. These drugs include the cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat Alzheimer's disease and the muscarinic receptor agonists used to treat urinary incontinence. The ACh-related DID is dose-dependent and may be caused by either overdose or idiosyncratic reactions. The ACh-related DID is characterized by watery, nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. The diarrhea is usually self-limiting and resolves within 24-48 hours of drug withdrawal. The diagnosis of DID is made by excluding other causes of diarrhea in patients taking a potentially causative drug. The treatment of DID is supportive, including rehydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Bethanechol is an anticholinergic that would exacerbate the symptoms of DID. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist that can cause diarrhea but would not be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case. Atropine is an anticholinergic that would exacerbate the symptoms of DID. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic that would exacerbate the symptoms of DID.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
