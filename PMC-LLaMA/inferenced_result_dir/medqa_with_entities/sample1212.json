    "question": "A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreasing calcium intake",
      "B": "Decreasing sodium intake",
      "C": "Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds",
      "D": "Urine acidification with cranberry juice"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's stone was composed of calcium oxalate, which comprises approximately 80% of all kidney stones. Dietary measures are recommended to prevent future stone formation. The most effective dietary intervention for preventing calcium oxalate stones is restricting dietary oxalate. Sources of oxalate include rhubarb, spinach, strawberries, chocolate, peanuts, and almonds. Therefore, decreasing calcium intake (Option A) would actually increase oxalate absorption and increase the risk of stone formation. Decreasing sodium intake (Option B) would decrease the amount of calcium in the urine, which would decrease the likelihood of stone formation. Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds (Option C) would actually increase oxalate intake and increase the risk of stone formation. Urine acidification with cranberry juice (Option D) would increase the likelihood of stone formation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
