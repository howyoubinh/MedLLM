    "question": "The parents of a 16-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus present requesting information about the drug, exenatide, an injectable drug that only needs to be administered once a week. The patient’s blood glucose levels have been difficult to control on his current insulin regimen due to poor adherence to recommended therapy, and he has had difficulty putting on weight despite eating copiously. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. His body mass index (BMI) is 19 kg/m2. Which of the following best describes why the patient should not be switched to exenatide?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Insulin production by the pancreas is insufficient for exenatide to be effective.",
      "B": "Exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia.",
      "C": "Suppression of appetite makes it even harder for him to gain weight.",
      "D": "Exenatide is contraindicated in children below 18 years."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is approved for use in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not effective in patients with type 1 diabetes because they do not have adequate insulin production. Exenatide is not effective in patients who are unwilling to follow a diabetic diet and monitor their blood glucose levels. It is not recommended for use in children less than 18 years old because safety and efficacy have not been established. Exenatide is given by subcutaneous injection and is not effective when given orally. Exenatide does not suppress insulin production and does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia. In fact, it can be used with insulin. Exenatide can cause nausea and vomiting, but it does not suppress appetite.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
