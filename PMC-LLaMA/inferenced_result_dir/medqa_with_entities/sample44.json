    "question": "A 45-year-old G5P4105 presents to her gynecologist’s office with six months of increasingly heavy periods. She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a “heavy feeling” in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Globular 10-week sized uterus",
      "B": "Adnexal mass",
      "C": "Irregular 14-week sized uterus",
      "D": "No remarkable physical exam finding"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s history of increasingly heavy and irregular menses, along with dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, is suggestive of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). AUB can be caused by a variety of factors, including endometrial or cervical polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, or infection. The patient’s age, history of obesity, and diabetes mellitus raise concern for endometrial cancer. The physical examination in patients with AUB can be normal, or it can reveal findings such as a globular uterus, suggesting adenomyosis or leiomyomas; an irregular uterus, suggesting a possible polyps or malignancy; or a diffusely enlarged uterus, suggesting a possible uterine leiomyoma. In this case, the patient’s irregularly shaped, 14-week-sized uterus suggests a possible endometrial polyp or endometrial cancer.\n\nAdnexal masses can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, but they are less likely to cause dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. A 10-week-sized uterus would be expected in a woman of reproductive age with no history of infertility or ovarian failure. A 14-week-sized uterus would be expected in a woman who is approximately 14 weeks pregnant.\n\nThe patient’s physical examination is most likely to reveal an irregularly shaped uterus, suggesting a possible polyp or malignancy.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
