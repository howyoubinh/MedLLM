    "question": "A 3-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for delayed passage of meconium. His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient’s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient’s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient’s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Abdominal radiograph",
      "B": "Contrast enema",
      "C": "Upper gastrointestinal series",
      "D": "Sweat testing"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with neonatal intestinal obstruction. The differential diagnosis includes duodenal atresia, jejunal atresia, ileal atresia, meconium plug syndrome, meconium ileus, and Hirschsprung’s disease. The next best step in management is to obtain an abdominal radiograph. The contrast enema and upper gastrointestinal series are both invasive and may delay definitive treatment. Hirschsprung’s disease is a consideration given the patient’s age and the absence of stool passage. However, the patient’s clinical presentation is more consistent with a mechanical obstruction. Sweat testing is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is a consideration given the patient’s Ashkenazi Jewish descent. However, the patient’s clinical presentation is more consistent with a mechanical obstruction.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
