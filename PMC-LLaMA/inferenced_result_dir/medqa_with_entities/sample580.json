    "question": "A 20-year-old woman is brought in for a psychiatric consultation by her mother who is concerned because of her daughter’s recent bizarre behavior. The patient’s father died from lung cancer 1 week ago. Though this has been stressful for the whole family, the daughter has been hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts ever since. These voices have conversations about her and how she should have been the one to die and they encourage her to kill herself. She has not been able to concentrate at work or at school. She has no other history of medical or psychiatric illness. She denies recent use of any medication. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F). On physical exam, she appears gaunt and anxious. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",

      "A": "Brief psychotic disorder",
      "B": "Adjustment disorder",
      "C": "Schizophrenia",
      "D": "Bereavement"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms of auditory hallucinations, thought broadcasting, and delusions of guilt over the death of her father and the need to die are characteristic of brief psychotic disorder. This disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last for a brief period of time (less than 1 month) and are often preceded by a severe psychosocial stressor. The symptoms of this disorder are similar to schizophrenia but are more sudden in onset and have a more favorable prognosis. The symptoms of adjustment disorder are not as severe and usually occur within 3 months of a stressor. The symptoms of bereavement can include depressed mood, poor concentration, and even hallucinations but do not usually include delusions or thought broadcasting. The symptoms of schizophrenia are usually more chronic and are not limited to a brief period of time.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
