    "question": "A 34-year-old woman is assaulted and suffers a number of stab wounds to her abdomen. Bystanders call paramedics and she is subsequently taken to the nearest hospital. On arrival to the emergency department, her vitals are T: 36 deg C, HR: 110 bpm, BP: 100/60, RR: 12, SaO2: 99%. A FAST and abdominal CT are promptly obtained which are demonstrated in Figures A and B, respectively. Her chart demonstrates no other medical problems and vaccinations/boosters up to date. The patient is diagnosed with a Grade V splenic laceration and is immediately brought to the OR for emergent splenectomy. The splenectomy is successfully performed with removal of the damaged spleen (Figure C). Following the operation, the patient should receive which of the following vaccines: (I) H. influenzae (II) Tetanus (III) N. meningitidis (IV) S. pneumoniae (V) Hepatitis B",

  "model_response": "The patient should receive all of the vaccines listed in the answer choices. The patient should receive vaccination against H. influenzae, Tetanus, N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and Hepatitis B. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine is indicated for all patients aged 2 months and older. Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) should be given to unimmunized or incompletely immunized patients with wounds that are contaminated or grossly infected. The polyvalent vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis (serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135) is indicated for patients 1 to 29 years of age who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is indicated for all children younger than 2 years of age, as well as for adults 65 years or older and for patients 2 years of age or older at increased risk of pneumococcal disease. Hepatitis B vaccine is indicated for all infants as well as for children and adults 2 years of age or older at increased risk of hepatitis B disease.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
