    "question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with confusion, anxiety, sweating, and episodes of vomiting. She is accompanied by her sister who says that her symptoms developed acutely and is unsure about what caused it. She is currently on methimazole, which she last took approximately 1 week ago. Approximately 5 days ago she developed an upper respiratory infection managed with bed rest and ibuprofen. Her temperature is 105°F (40.6°C), blood pressure is 95/68 mmHg, pulse is 145/min, and respirations are 23/min. On physical examination, the patient has altered mentation and is agitated and diaphoretic. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Antibiotics",
      "B": "Carotid massage",
      "C": "Clonazepam",
      "D": "Propranolol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with thyrotoxic crisis (thyroid storm). This is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. It is usually precipitated by infection, surgery, or trauma. The treatment includes intravenous fluids, cooling the patient with ice packs, treating the precipitating cause, and administering oxygen, sedation, and antibiotics. Propranolol should be given to slow the heart rate. If this measure fails, additional medications such as esmolol may be required. If the patient is tremulous, diazepam (Valium) should be given. If there is no improvement, or if the patient's condition deteriorates, diltiazem may be given to reduce peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
