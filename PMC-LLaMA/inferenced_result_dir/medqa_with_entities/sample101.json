    "question": "A 65-year old man presents with gradually worsening rigidity of his arms and legs and slowness in performing tasks. He says he has also noticed hand tremors, which increase at rest and decrease with focused movements. On examination, the patient does not swing his arms while walking and has a shortened, shuffling gait. An antiviral drug is prescribed which alleviates the patient’s symptoms. Which of the following drugs was most likely prescribed to this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amantadine",
      "B": "Ribavirin",
      "C": "Levodopa",
      "D": "Zidovudine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are consistent with Parkinson’s disease. Amantadine is an antiviral drug that is also used in the treatment of early Parkinson’s disease. It is thought to work by increasing the release of dopamine and by inhibiting its reuptake. Ribavirin is an antiviral drug used to treat hepatitis C. Levodopa is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Zidovudine is an antiviral drug used in the treatment of HIV.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
