    "question": "A 25-year-old female presents to urgent care with complaints of one day of burning and pain with urination, urgency, and frequency. She denies having a fever but has experienced intermittent chills. She is sexually active and inconsistently uses condoms. The patient has no past medical history. She is allergic to sulfa drugs. Physical examination of the genitalia is normal. Urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar. She is treated with an antibiotic and her symptoms quickly improve. The mechanism of the antibiotic she was most likely treated with is which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inhibits cell wall synthesis",
      "B": "Binds D-ala D-ala in the cell wall",
      "C": "Inhibits initiation complex",
      "D": "Inhibits sterol synthesis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient was treated with an antibiotic that inhibits cell wall synthesis. This mechanism of action is effective against gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar, which is indicative of lactose fermentation. The most common of these gram-negative rods is Escherichia coli. The most common antibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis are beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. The other choices are mechanisms of action of antibiotics that are effective against other types of bacteria.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
