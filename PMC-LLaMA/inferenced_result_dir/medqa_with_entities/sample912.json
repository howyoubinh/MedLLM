    "question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician after returning from her honeymoon in Cancun. A few days ago, she began to notice an eruption of small red bumps that cover her torso, back, and buttocks. The patient first thought she had acne, but became worried when the rash continued to itch. The patient denies other symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam is notable for red papules and pustules scattered across the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks, while sparing the limbs. Closer examination indicates inflammation of the hair follicles. Culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive. What other finding is commonly observed in the culture of the most likely organism?",
