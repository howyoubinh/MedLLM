    "question": "A 54-year-old male makes an appointment with his primary care physician due to chronic fatigue that has left him unable to hike or do other physically demanding activities with his friends. He has well-controlled hypertension and diabetes but has otherwise been healthy. He does not smoke but drinks socially with his friends. Physical exam reveals enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation. A biopsy is obtained showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18. The regulation of which of the following proteins will be most abnormal in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Caspase-9",
      "B": "CD15",
      "C": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 4",
      "D": "Ras pathway transcription factors"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This is a case of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). The characteristic chromosomal translocation is t(11;14)(q13;q32). The translocation partner is the B-cell transcription factor Oct-1 (POU domain, class 2, transcription factor 1; Oct-1) on chromosome 14. Oct-1 is a transcriptional activator of B-cell specific genes, including BCL2. NLPHL is characterized by BCL2 expression and the absence of CD15 and CD30 expression. Caspase-9 is involved in apoptosis. CD15 is expressed in the Hodgkin lymphomas. The Ras pathway transcription factors are involved in cell proliferation. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 is involved in cell cycle regulation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
