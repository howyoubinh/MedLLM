    "question": "While on a teaching sabbatical in Uruguay, a pathologist examined the excised liver of an 18-year-old otherwise healthy female who passed away due to massive hepatic necrosis 5 days after she underwent general anesthesia to repair a fractured femur. Which of the following is a general anesthetic most likely responsible for her death?",

      "A": "Lidocaine",
      "B": "Midazolam",

Halothane is a volatile inhalational anesthetic. It is not commonly used in developed countries due to its unstable cardiovascular effects and potential for hepatotoxicity. Desflurane is an inhalational anesthetic. It is not commonly associated with hepatotoxicity. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic. It is not commonly associated with hepatotoxicity. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine. It is not commonly associated with hepatotoxicity.}\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
