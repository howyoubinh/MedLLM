    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago. The mass is painless and has not increased in size since then. He has also noticed occasional fatigue and has gained 10 pounds in the past 4 months despite no change in his diet or exercise frequency. His past medical history is notable for gout for which he takes allopurinol. He denies any prior thyroid disorder. He runs 4 times per week and eats a balanced diet of mostly fruits and vegetables. He does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine with dinner. His family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer in his maternal uncle. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 127/72 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, he has a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid. A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles",
      "B": "Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate",
      "C": "Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis",
      "D": "Stromal amyloid deposition"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with Hashimoto thyroiditis. The diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles is characteristic of Hashimoto thyroiditis. This autoimmune disorder is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in adults. The patient's fatigue and weight gain are consistent with hypothyroidism. The firm and symmetric thyroid exam finding is consistent with this diagnosis as well. Hashimoto thyroiditis is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, specifically papillary thyroid cancer. The patient's family history of medullary thyroid cancer is not associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis. The other choices are not consistent with Hashimoto thyroiditis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
