    "question": "A 27-year-old woman with no past medical history presents to the emergency department with recurrent wrist and neck pain for the last 2 months. She reports that her fingers feel stiff in the morning and the symptoms tend to improve as the day progresses. She denies any recent trauma or other inciting events. Family history is significant for a grandmother who suffered from fibromyalgia. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 16/min, and heart rate is 70/min. On physical examination, her metacarpophalangeal joints are erythematous and tender. Which of the following would be most helpful for diagnosing this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Synovial fluid analysis",
      "B": "Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody",
      "C": "Rheumatoid factor",
      "D": "X-ray of cervical spine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The most helpful test for diagnosing RA is the rheumatoid factor. The other listed tests are used in the diagnosis of other conditions. Synovial fluid analysis is used in the diagnosis of septic arthritis, gout, and pseudogout. Anti-CCP antibodies are highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis, but have poor sensitivity. Rheumatoid factor is positive in 70% to 80% of patients with RA, but it is nonspecific. X-ray of the cervical spine is used in the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
