    "question": "A 32-year-old male presents to the ED with acute-onset chest pain. His blood pressure is 157/90 mmHg and his his pulse is 116/min. He appears anxious and agitated and a careful exam reveals dilated pupils and a perforated nasal septum. An EKG reveals ST segment elevation so he is urgently taken for cardiac intervention. Upon review, this patient reveals that he has not had care from a physician since he graduated from college. In the interim he has been largely unemployed and admits that he has recently been homeless. When asked directly, the patient admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine",
      "B": "Inhibiting breakdown of biogenic amines",
      "C": "Antagonizing the NMDA receptor",
      "D": "Inhibiting the GABA receptor"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is most consistent with acute amphetamine toxicity. Amphetamines work by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their concentration in the synaptic cleft. Amphetamines can cause a variety of cardiovascular effects, including hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmias. The pupillary dilatation and perforated nasal septum are also consistent with amphetamine use. The other listed agents do not have these effects.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
