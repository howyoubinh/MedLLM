    "question": "An 18-year-old patient is visiting the pediatrician with her mother for her annual exam before college starts. Her height and weight are appropriate for her age, and she is up to date on all her vaccinations and has no medical complaints. She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn’t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, “Nobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I’ll end up getting rejected.” Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter’s behavior?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Schizotypal personality disorder",
      "B": "Generalized anxiety disorder",
      "C": "Avoidant personality disorder",
      "D": "Dependent personality disorder"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely explanation for the daughter's behavior is avoidant personality disorder (APD). APD is characterized by pervasive social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation or rejection. Individuals with APD may avoid social interaction or endure social situations with extreme discomfort. They may also have low self-esteem and be highly self-conscious, feeling intensely vulnerable and easily embarrassed. Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is characterized by odd or eccentric behavior and pervasive social and interpersonal deficits. Individuals with SPD may have odd beliefs or magical thinking, odd ways of communication, and may be uncomfortable in social situations. However, they do not typically experience the intense fear of rejection or avoidance of social interaction seen in individuals with APD. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, uncontrolled, and irrational worry about everyday things that is out of propoion to the actual source of the worry. Individuals with GAD may experience restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. While individuals with GAD may experience social anxiety, it is not the primary feature of the disorder. Dependent personality disorder (DPD) is characterized by an excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive and clinging behavior, and fears of separation. Individuals with DPD may have difficulty making decisions and feel helpless when alone. They may have low self-esteem and be easily influenced by others. However, they do not typically experience the intense fear of rejection or avoidance of social interaction seen in individuals with APD.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
