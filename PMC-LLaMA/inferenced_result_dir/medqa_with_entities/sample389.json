    "question": "A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Anterior cord lesion",
      "B": "Posterior cord lesion",
      "C": "Right cord hemisection",
      "D": "Left cord hemisection"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a presentation consistent with an anterior cord syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by loss of motor function, pain, and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion due to interruption of the anterior horns and the spinothalamic tract. Vibration and proprioception are typically spared because of their location in the dorsal columns. This patient has a stab wound to the back, which is a common mechanism for causing a cord syndrome. The other choices do not fit the clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
