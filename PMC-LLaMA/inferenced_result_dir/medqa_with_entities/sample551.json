    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes",
      "B": "Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase",
      "C": "Decreased proteolysis",
      "D": "Increased lipoprotein lipase activity"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), which is characterized by decreased insulin production by the pancreatic beta cells. The lack of insulin results in increased glucagon levels. Glucagon acts via cyclic AMP to activate hormone-sensitive lipase, resulting in the breakdown of stored triglycerides in adipocytes. This leads to the release of free fatty acids and glycerol into the circulation. The free fatty acids are taken up by the liver and converted to triglycerides and ketone bodies. The ketone bodies are released into the blood and are used by the brain as an energy source. The brain lacks glucose-6-phosphatase and cannot utilize ketone bodies. In DM, the lack of insulin also leads to decreased proteolysis and increased lipoprotein lipase activity.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
