    "question": "A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his son with a fever over the past day. The patient’s son adds that his father has been having some behavioral problems, as well, and that he was complaining about bugs crawling over his skin this morning even though there were no insects. Past medical history is unremarkable. No current medications. The patient was an alcoholic for several years but abruptly quit drinking 5 days ago. The patient’s temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse is 130/min, blood pressure is 146/88 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, he is confused, restless, agitated, and lacks orientation to time, place or person. Which of the following the most appropriate initial course of treatment of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chlorpromazine",
      "B": "Clonidine",
      "C": "Diazepam",
      "D": "Haloperidol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s presentation is consistent with delirium. Delirium is characterized by acute onset, clouding of consciousness, disorientation, and a variety of other cognitive and perceptual abnormalities. The most common cause of delirium in the elderly is medication: drugs with anticholinergic activity, narcotics, sedativehypnotics, and alcohol. Other causes of delirium include infection, trauma, hypoxia, hypovolemia, substance abuse, metabolic derangements, and central nervous system tumors or vascular lesions. The initial treatment of delirium involves correction of the underlying cause, including the discontinuation of offending medications. The patient’s agitation and restlessness can be treated with a neuroleptic agent such as haloperidol (5-10 mg orally or intravenously). Chlorpromazine and thioridazine are also effective in treating agitation and restlessness, but they have a higher incidence of side effects than haloperidol. Clonidine, a central alpha-adrenergic agonist, may also be used to treat agitation in delirium, but it is less effective than haloperidol. Diazepam is a sedative-hypnotic that may be used to treat agitation and insomnia in delirium, but it carries a risk of exacerbating the confusion and cognitive dysfunction.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
