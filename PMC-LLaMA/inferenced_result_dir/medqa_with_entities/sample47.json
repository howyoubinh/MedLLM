    "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Femoropopliteal artery stenosis",
      "B": "Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein",

  "model_response": "The symptoms of claudication in the right leg are typical of arterial disease. The absence of pedal pulses and the finding of femoral pulses are diagnostic of aortoiliac disease. The symptoms of claudication are relieved by rest, and the pain is reproduced by exercise. The symptoms are often described as a cramp or ache in the muscle group that is being exercised. The pain is not present on taking the first step (intermittent claudication) and is relieved by standing still (rest pain). The location of the pain is characteristic of the level of the occlusion. Symptoms of neurologic claudication are often associated with lumbar spinal stenosis. The pain is associated with walking and is relieved by sitting or changing positions. The pain is often described as a feeling of fatigue or cramping in the buttocks, hips, and thighs. It is not present on taking the first step (unlike vascular claudication) and is relieved by sitting or changing positions. The pain is not reproducible by exercise (unlike vascular claudication).\n\nThe symptoms of venous claudication are often described as a feeling of congestion or tightness in the lower calf. The pain is relieved by elevation of the leg and is reproduced by exercise. Venous claudication is often seen in patients with venous insufficiency.\n\nThe symptoms of arterial claudication are often described as a cramp or ache in the muscle group that is being exercised.
