    "question": "A 27-year-old woman was referred to a dermatology clinic due to a changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue. Although she has not had any recent changes in her daily routines, she also complains of increasing fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. She has a blood pressure of 126/77 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min, and heart rate of 88/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies and increased creatinine kinase were found in her serum. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Mixed connective tissue disease",
      "B": "Polymyositis",
      "C": "Systemic sclerosis",
      "D": "Rheumatoid arthritis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's symptoms are suggestive of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), which is characterized by high titers of anti-U1 RNP antibodies. MCTD is associated with features of systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and polymyositis. Patients with MCTD have a good prognosis, although renal disease is common.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
