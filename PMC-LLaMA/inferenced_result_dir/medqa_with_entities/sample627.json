    "question": "A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour. Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient's pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta. The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, during which her blood pressure decreases from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg. What is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hysterectomy",
      "B": "Intravenous oxytocin",
      "C": "Elevate posterior fornix",
      "D": "Red blood cell transfusion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a retained placenta. The initial management of this condition is manual extraction or curettage. In this case, the placenta was partially abrupted and infected, leading to significant bleeding and a retained placental mass. The best next step in management is hysterectomy to control the bleeding and prevent the morbidity associated with a retained placenta. Intravenous oxytocin may be used after the placenta is removed to help control bleeding. Elevating the posterior fornix may help in the delivery of the placenta, but it will not control bleeding from a retained placental mass. Red blood cell transfusion may be necessary if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, but it will not control bleeding from a retained placental mass.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
