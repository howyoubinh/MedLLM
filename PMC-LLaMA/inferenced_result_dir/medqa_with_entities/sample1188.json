    "question": "After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, most of its development takes place in the thymus. It passes through several stages during its maturation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes, and it ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?",

When exposed to an antigen, they divide rapidly and produce large numbers of new T cells sensitized to that antigen."

Bone marrow is made up of a framework of connective tissue containing branching fibers with the frame being filled with marrow cells."
