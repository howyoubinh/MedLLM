    "question": "An 8-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of hematuria. Two weeks ago, she had a sore throat that resolved without treatment. Physical examination shows 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Urinalysis shows numerous RBCs and 3+ proteinuria. Her antistreptolysin O titer is elevated. Formation of which of the following is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells",
      "B": "Tissue-specific antibodies",
      "C": "Antigen-antibody complexes",
      "D": "Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Antibodies specific for a streptococcal antigen (e.g., antistreptolysin O) are formed. These antibodies can bind to the streptococcal antigen or a self-antigen, forming an antigen-antibody complex. The complex can deposit in glomeruli, where complement is activated and tissue damage occurs. IgE is involved in type I hypersensitivity, which is an immediate (e.g., anaphylaxis) rather than a delayed hypersensitivity response. Tissue-specific antibodies are formed in some autoimmune diseases, but these are not involved in glomerulonephritis. Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are involved in type II hypersensitivity reactions, which are cytotoxic responses.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
