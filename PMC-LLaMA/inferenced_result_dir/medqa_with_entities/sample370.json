    "question": "A 15-year-old boy with poorly controlled asthma presents to the emergency room complaining of severe shortness of breath. His mother reports that he had trouble breathing soon after he started playing soccer with some friends and was unable to use his inhaler as it was empty. His family history is notable for emphysema in his paternal uncle and cirrhosis in his maternal grandfather. The child’s temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Physical examination demonstrates wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. The child is started on supplemental oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased leukotriene activity",
      "B": "Activation of muscarinic receptors",
      "C": "Decreased phosphodiesterase activity",
      "D": "Increased adenylate cyclase activity"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The child’s symptoms are consistent with an acute exacerbation of asthma. The primary pathology in asthma is airway hyper-reactivity (AHR), which is the excessive bronchoconstriction to a given stimulus. The most common medications used to treat asthma are bronchodilators, which work by increasing levels of cAMP via stimulation of b2 -adrenergic receptors, which are GsPCRs. This results in activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates proteins leading to relaxation of airway smooth muscle and bronchodilation. The other choices are not downstream effects of b2 -adrenergic receptor stimulation. Leukotrienes are potent bronchoconstrictors that are increased in asthmatic airways and can be targeted by montelukast, which is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors are activated by acetylcholine and can cause bronchoconstriction. This is why medications such as ipratropium bromide, which are muscarinic receptor antagonists, can be used in the treatment of COPD. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are enzymes that break down cAMP, so inhibition of PDEs would lead to increased cAMP levels and activation of PKA. However, PDE inhibitors are not commonly used to treat asthma. Adenylate cyclase is the enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP, so increasing adenylate cyclase activity would also lead to increased cAMP levels and activation of PKA.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
