    "question": "A 27-year-old graduate student is bitten by a coral snake while he was hiking alone through the woods and dies 2 hours later from respiratory failure. His body was discovered 7 hours later by a group of campers who promptly called the police. On arrival, the police found his body to be cold and stiff. Which of the following processes is responsible for the rigidity observed?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins",
      "B": "Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins",
      "C": "Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling",
      "D": "Depletion of intracellular calcium"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The student died of respiratory failure caused by the neurotoxin of the coral snake. Muscles are incapable of contracting without an adequate supply of calcium ions, and the neurotoxin acted to deplete intracellular calcium. The cold temperature of the environment would tend to inhibit muscle contraction by decreasing the activation energy required for the conformational change of the cross-bridge cycle. A muscle in a rigor mortis state is incapable of contracting because of the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling. The activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins is not a likely process in this case because the student was alone when he was bitten.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
