    "question": "A 58-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician with concerns about several recent health changes. The patient has recently gained weight and can't seem to exercise like she used to. She also notes that her thinking seems slow. Physical examination shows thickened, dry skin. Serum analysis confirms the physician's suspicions. Which of the following findings was most helpful in the diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "High T4 and T3",
      "B": "Low T4 and T3",
      "C": "High TSH",
      "D": "Hypercholesterolemia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has hypothyroidism. The weight gain, slowed thinking, and skin changes are all common symptoms. The elevated TSH is diagnostic. The T4 and T3 levels can be used to determine the cause of the hypothyroidism (e.g., primary vs. secondary). The TSH level is elevated because the pituitary gland is still trying to stimulate thyroid hormone production. The other choices are not consistent with the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
