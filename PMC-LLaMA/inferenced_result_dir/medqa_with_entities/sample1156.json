    "question": "A 7-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding. He was delivered at term to a 32-year-old woman. He is not able to sit upright on his own. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 150/min, and respirations are 50/min. His tongue protrudes beyond the teeth. Neck veins are distended. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Neurologic examination shows profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. He has 2+ reflexes bilaterally. A chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly. Serum glucose is 105 mg/dL. Which of the following is the enzyme most likely to be defective in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Muscle glycogen phosphorylase",
      "B": "Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase",
      "C": "Lysosomal acid maltase",

  "model_response": "The patient has Pompe disease, which is caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid maltase. The disease is characterized by accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes. The heart, skeletal muscles, liver, and nervous system are particularly affected. The disease is fatal in infancy or early childhood. The other enzymes listed are involved in glycogen metabolism, but their deficiency leads to different clinical syndromes.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
