    "question": "A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her brother for severe chest pain. The patient recently lost her husband in a car accident and is still extremely shocked by the event. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 105/67 mm Hg, the heart rate is 96/min and regular, breathing rate is 23/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. An S3 heart sound and rales in the lower right and left lung lobes are heard. A 12-lead ECG shows no significant findings. Echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium. The patient is stabilized and informed about the diagnosis and possible treatment options. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Atrial fibrillation",
      "B": "Constrictive pericarditis",
      "C": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy",
      "D": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's history of sudden emotional stress, enlarged left heart chambers, and rales suggest acute pulmonary edema. The absence of ST-T wave changes on the ECG and the presence of an S3 heart sound suggest acute left ventricular failure. The most common cause of acute left ventricular failure is acute myocardial infarction. However, in this case, the absence of ECG changes and the presence of rales suggest acute pulmonary edema due to acute mitral valve regurgitation. Acute mitral valve regurgitation is most commonly caused by papillary muscle rupture, which is usually caused by an acute myocardial infarction involving the posteromedial papillary muscle. The other choices are not associated with acute pulmonary edema.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
