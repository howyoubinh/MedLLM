    "question": "A 27-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by police when she attacked her date outside of a pizza restaurant. The patient refused to explain her behavior to the police. She seemed to be responding to internal stimuli when being initially interviewed. The patient has a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and obesity. The patient has a known history of medication non-compliance. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam the patient is poorly kempt and has an odd body odor. Inspection of her oropharynx reveals multiple ulcers. Cardiac exam is unrevealing with the exception of a friction rub. Since the incident, the patient has calmed down and is currently resting. She is no longer responding to internal stimuli and is more cooperative. Lab values are obtained and are below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 135 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 70 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.7 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.0 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.5 mEq/L\n\nHemoglobin: 10 g/dL\nHematocrit: 35%\nReticulocyte count: 4.9%\nPlatelet count: 275,000/mm^3\nLeukocyte count: 5,500/mm^3\n\nWhich of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "IM haloperidol",
      "B": "Clozapine",
      "C": "Urine toxicology",
      "D": "ANA and anti-dsDNA levels"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's lab values reveal a metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate) and an elevated BUN with normal creatinine. The patient's mental status changes are likely due to her underlying psychiatric conditions. The patient's physical exam is significant for multiple ulcers in her oropharynx, which could be a sign of a viral infection such as herpes simplex virus. The patient's history of non-compliance with her medications further supports a diagnosis of a psychiatric illness. The patient's lab values and history are most consistent with a diagnosis of psychosis secondary to a viral infection. The next best step in management would be to treat the patient with intravenous haloperidol to help control her symptoms.
