    "question": "A patient is unresponsive in the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. The patient's written advance directive states that he does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. The patient's wife arrives and demands that \"everything\" be done to keep him alive because she \"can't go on living without him.\" The patient's adult son is on his way to the hospital. If the patient arrests, which of the following should occur?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Respect the wife's wishes and resuscitate the patient",
      "B": "Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate",
      "C": "Consult a judge for the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate",
      "D": "Consult the hospital ethics committee"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's prior wishes, as stated in his written advance directive, should be respected. If the patient's wife wishes to attempt resuscitation, she can be given the opportunity to say goodbye to the patient before a decision is made to withdraw ventilatory support. The wife's wishes should not take precedence over the patient's prior wishes. The son's wishes should not take precedence over the patient's prior wishes. A judge is not necessary. The hospital ethics committee should not be consulted in this case.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
