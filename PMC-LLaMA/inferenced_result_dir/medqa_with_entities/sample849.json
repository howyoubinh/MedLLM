    "question": "Two weeks after starting chemotherapy with etoposide, a 66-year-old man with small cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of persistent nausea and vomiting. His symptoms improve significantly after the administration of metoclopramide. This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Vestibular nerve",
      "B": "Intestinal smooth muscle",
      "C": "Vagus nerve",
      "D": "Area postrema"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The area postrema is located on the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata, and it is a pa of the chemoreceptor trigger zone. The area postrema is a pa of the brain that is not protected by the blood-brain barrier. It is a pa of the vomiting center, and it is stimulated by emetic substances that are present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The vestibular nerve is a pa of the auditory and vestibular system and is not directly involved in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Intestinal smooth muscle is not directly involved in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The vagus nerve is involved in the parasympathetic control of the stomach and upper intestine and is not directly involved in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
