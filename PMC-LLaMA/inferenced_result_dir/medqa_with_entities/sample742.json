    "question": "A 23-year-old woman visits her obstetrician for an antenatal appointment. She is at the 24th week of gestation. She has had type 1 diabetes mellitus for 5 years and is on insulin. She also has mitral stenosis, for which she has been advised to undergo a balloon valvotomy. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/minute. Her random blood glucose is 220 mg/dL and HbA1C is 8.5%. She wants to discuss possible complications concerning her pregnancy. Which of the following cardiac complications is her infant at high risk for?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy",
      "B": "Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "C": "Tetralogy of Fallot",
      "D": "Mitral valve prolapse"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The infant is at high risk for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. This is a condition in which the interventricular septum is hypertrophied, leading to left ventricular outflow obstruction. It is seen in 5% of children born to mothers with diabetes mellitus. The condition is usually asymptomatic in childhood but may become symptomatic during adolescence or pregnancy. It is usually treated with beta-blockers. Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a self-limiting condition seen in about 25% of infants born to diabetic mothers. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that includes ventricular septal defect, right ventricular outflow obstruction, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. It is not associated with diabetes mellitus. Mitral valve prolapse is a condition in which the mitral valve does not close properly, and it is not associated with diabetes mellitus.
