    "question": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for a rash on his trunk, which he has had for the past 2 days. She notes that he is eating less and is more cranky than usual. His birth history is insignificant, and his immunizations are up to date. Vital signs include: temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is diagnosed with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Which of the following is involved with the primary defense in response to the bacteria and toxins produced by this organism?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Immunoglobulin- IgG",

  "model_response": "Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is caused by an exfoliative toxin produced by S. aureus. The toxin destroys the desmosomes that hold the epidermal layer of the skin together. The primary defense against this organism and its toxins is the immunoglobulin IgG. IgG is the predominant antibody in the secondary immune response. IgD is an uncommon antibody that is found on the surface of many B lymphocytes. IgA is the main immunoglobulin found in mucosal areas. IgM is the main immunoglobulin found in the primary immune response.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
