    "question": "A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Headache and tinnitus",
      "B": "Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits",
      "C": "Pedal edema and flushing",
      "D": "Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient was prescribed flecainide, a class Ic antiarrhythmic drug. At high doses, flecainide can cause headache and tinnitus. It is a potent inhibitor of the Na channel and has no effect on repolarization. It can also block myocardial potassium channels, which can cause a prolonged QRS complex. Flecainide is also a nonselective beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It can cause bronchospasm, flushing, and pedal edema. It is contraindicated in patients with atrioventricular block or sinus bradycardia. Flecainide is also contraindicated in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is no evidence of hypothyroidism or corneal deposits. There is no evidence of phototoxicity or pedal edema.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
