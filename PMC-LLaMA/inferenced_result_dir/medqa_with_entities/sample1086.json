    "question": "A 3-day-old boy is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for seizures. He was born to a 33-year-old woman at 31 weeks gestation via cesarean section. His birth weight was 1400 grams. Vital signs are significant for systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. On physical exam, the patient has an altered level of consciousness with decreased spontaneous and elicited movements. The patient is hypotonic on motor testing, has bulging anterior fontanelle, and appears cyanotic. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Complete blood count",
      "B": "Cranial ultrasonography",
      "C": "Head CT",
      "D": "MRI of the head"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation is consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The initial step in management is to stabilize the patient, which may include mechanical ventilation, correction of hypotension, and treatment of seizures. After stabilization, further diagnostic evaluation should include cranial ultrasonography to assess the extent of cerebral edema and to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage. An electroencephalogram (EEG) should be obtained to assess for subclinical seizure activity. MRI of the brain may provide additional information but is not typically obtained as part of the initial evaluation. A complete blood count may be obtained to assess for a bleeding diathesis, but this is not the best next step in management.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
