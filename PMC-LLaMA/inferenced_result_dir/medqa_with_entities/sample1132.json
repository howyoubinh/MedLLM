    "question": "A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma",
      "B": "Dissection of an intracerebral vessel",
      "C": "Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm",
      "D": "Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s headache is most likely due to dilation of intracerebral arterioles. The throbbing, band-like headache that is worse in the morning and worsens with coughing or straining is typical of migraine. The fact that the headache is not aggravated by movements and is not accompanied by other typical migraine symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and that it is linked to a preceding acute illness (runny nose and fever) suggest that the headache is a “complicated migraine.” Complicated migraines are migraines that are triggered by infections, changes in weather, or other acute illnesses. The underlying mechanism is vascular dilation. The other options are less likely. A chronic subdural hematoma would be accompanied by focal neurologic symptoms. Intracerebral vessel dissection would be associated with focal neurologic symptoms. A growing intracranial neoplasm would be associated with focal neurologic symptoms.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

In addition, rosuvastatin, like other statins, exhibits pro-apoptotic, growth inhibitory, and pro-differentiation activities in a variety of tumor cell types; these antineoplastic activities may be due, in part, to inhibition of the isoprenylation of Ras and Rho GTPases and related signaling cascades."
