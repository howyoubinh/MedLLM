He was born at 40 weeks' gestation at 2514 g (5.54 lb) to a 28-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, by an uncomplicated cesarean section. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. The infant's temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 170/min, and blood pressure is 71/39 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. These symptoms are mostly like due to maternal use of which of the following?",
