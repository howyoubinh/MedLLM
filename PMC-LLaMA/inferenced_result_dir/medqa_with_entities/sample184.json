    "question": "A 78-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 5 weeks. He had been living independently but came to live with his daughter temporarily after he complained that he was unable to perform some of his daily activities. He has left the front door wide open and tap water running on multiple occasions. He does not sleep well and wakes up 6â€“7 times during the night. He does not leave his room and rarely makes conversation with his daughter. He says that he used to enjoy playing the piano but has not played for several months. He has hypertension treated with amlodipine. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows orientation to person, place, and time and psychomotor retardation. He has a blunted affect. Short- and long-term memory is impaired. Attention and concentration are impaired. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum concentration of electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 are within the reference range. He is very concerned about his memory lapses. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Fluoxetine",
      "B": "Aspirin",
      "C": "Ventriculoperitoneal shunt",
      "D": "Memantine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's cognitive decline and impairment of activities of daily living developed acutely over a period of 5 weeks. The history of leaving the front door open and of turning on the tap water are suggestive of impairment in executive functions. The patient has no significant findings on physical examination and laboratory studies. The most likely diagnosis is dementia, and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly is Alzheimer's disease (AD). The frontal lobe is the area of the brain most closely associated with executive functions, and the most common finding in AD is neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal and temporal lobes. The mainstay of treatment for AD is the use of centrally acting cholinergic agents. The most commonly used cholinergic agents are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine). These agents inhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine and thus increase the availability of this neurotransmitter. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. It is not indicated in the treatment of AD. Aspirin is used for its antiplatelet effect and to prevent cardiovascular events. It is not indicated in the treatment of AD. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is used in the treatment of normal-pressure hydrocephalus, which is characterized by gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia. This patient's clinical picture is not consistent with normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist indicated in the treatment of AD.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
