    "question": "A 35-year-old man visits your office for his annual health checkup. He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 6 months ago, which is being treated with citalopram. He comments that his symptoms have improved since initiating the prescribed therapy; however, in the past 2 months, he has been unable to have sexual intercourse due to weak tumescence and low libido. His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Lowering citalopram dose",
      "B": "Addition of bupropion",
      "C": "Switch to fluoxetine",
      "D": "Switch to selegiline"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is experiencing a common sexual side effect associated with the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The most appropriate step in the management of this patient is to switch him to a different antidepressant, such as bupropion. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant that is not associated with sexual side effects. The other options listed are not appropriate choices because they are also SSRIs and therefore may cause similar sexual side effects.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
