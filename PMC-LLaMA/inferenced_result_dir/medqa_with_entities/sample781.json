    "question": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.",
      "B": "A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.",
      "C": "A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.",
      "D": "A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Inhibition of this pathway by hypoxia leads to an accumulation of HIF-1α. A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.\n\n###COMMENT:\n\nA Southern blot is used to detect DNA, not RNA.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
