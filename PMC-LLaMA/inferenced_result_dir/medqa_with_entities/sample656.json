    "question": "A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife for severe abdominal pain for the past 1 hour. He is unable to give more information about the nature of his pain. His wife says that he has peptic ulcer disease and is being treated with antacids without a good response. She adds that he vomited repeatedly  in the last couple of hours, his vomitus being brown/red in color. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. A physical exam reveals a tense abdomen with a board like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness. An erect abdominal x-ray is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Duodenal peptic ulcer",
      "B": "Gastric peptic ulcer",
      "C": "Pancreatitis",
      "D": "Perforated gastric peptic ulcer"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The erect abdominal x-ray shows free air under the diaphragm. The presence of free air under the diaphragm in an erect abdominal x-ray is diagnostic of a perforated viscus. The most common cause of acute abdominal pain, resulting in death or the need for emergency surgery, is a perforated ulcer. The most common site of a perforated ulcer is the first part of the duodenum. The clinical presentation of a perforated ulcer is one of an acute abdomen characterized by sudden and severe abdominal pain, usually accompanied by vomiting. Patients may have a history of peptic ulcer disease, and the pain may be described as being in the epigastric region and radiating to the back. The physical examination reveals abdominal rigidity and rebound tenderness. Patients may have a tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. Abdominal films may show free intraperitoneal air under the diaphragm, indicating a perforated viscus. The air may also be seen as a crescentic gas shadow outlining an organ such as the liver, the falciform ligament, or the abdominal wall.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
