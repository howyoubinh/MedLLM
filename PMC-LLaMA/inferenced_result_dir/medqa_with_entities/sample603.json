    "question": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of a painless, nonpruritic skin lesion on her right thigh. She initially thought it was an insect bite, but it has slowly increased in size over the past weeks. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule. When the skin lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. A photograph of the lesion is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dermatofibroma",
      "B": "Cherry hemangioma",
      "C": "Actinic keratosis",
      "D": "Seborrheic keratosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is D. Seborrheic keratosis. The history of a slowly enlarging, painless, hyperpigmented papule with the characteristic \"pearly\" rolled edge is typical of a seborrheic keratosis. These lesions are benign and can be easily removed by curettage. Dermatofibromas are usually associated with a history of trauma and have a characteristic dimpled appearance when rubbed with the examining finger. Cherry hemangiomas are bright red, domed papules that blanch with pressure. Actinic keratoses are scaly, pink, irregular plaques or papules that occur on sun-exposed areas. Basal cell carcinomas are usually pigmented and have a characteristic \"strawberry\" appearance.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
