    "question": "A 67-year-old man is brought to the physician because of increasing forgetfulness, unsteadiness, and falls over the past year. He reports that these symptoms seem to worsen with each fall. Initially, he could not remember directions to his home but now cannot remember recent conversations or appointments he has made. He often repeats questions that he asked shortly before. He has long-standing hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, carvedilol, enalapril, and atorvastatin. Examination shows a bruise over the left temple and an unsteady gait. On mental status examination, he is oriented to place and person only. Short-term memory is impaired; he can recall 0 out of 5 objects after 10 minutes. Long-term memory is intact. He has no delusions or hallucinations. Muscle strength is decreased in the left lower extremity. The Babinski sign is present on the left. A CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Warfarin therapy",
      "B": "Vitamin E therapy",
      "C": "Tetrabenazine therapy",
      "D": "Cognitive training"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The CT scan shows a large, crescent-shaped hyperdense lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere. The patient has a clinical history that is typical for a large atherosclerotic infarction involving the distribution of the middle cerebral artery. The initial management of this patient should include the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) if the patient has no contraindications to therapy. The other choices are not appropriate. Warfarin therapy is not indicated because the patient has a large infarction, not a hemorrhage. Vitamin E therapy has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with cerebrovascular disease. Tetrabenazine therapy is used in the treatment of patients with movement disorders. Cognitive training is not likely to be effective in the management of this patient because his mental status examination shows evidence of significant impairment.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
