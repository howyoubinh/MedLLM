    "question": "A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Help the parents to arrange supportive care at home",
      "B": "Refer the patient to another oncologist",
      "C": "Recommend for parents to take 2 weeks to think about decision",
      "D": "Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "If a patient refuses standard therapy, the physician should make every effort to provide the best possible palliative care. The parents' wishes should be supported as long as they do not involve clear harm to the child. The physician should help the parents to arrange supportive care and palliation at home, including adequate pain control. The physician should not refer the patient to another oncologist without the parents' consent. The physician should not recommend delaying the decision about treatment for 2 weeks, because the tumor is rapidly growing and unresectable without chemotherapy. A court order should not be sought without the parents' consent.\n\n###COMMENT:Neuroblastoma is the third most common pediatric malignancy and the peak incidence is 2 years of age. It arises from neural crest tissue of the sympathetic ganglia or adrenal medulla. High-risk factors include age younger than 1 year, stage 3 or 4, and certain histologic and molecular markers. Favorable prognostic markers include hyperdiploidy and trk-B expression. Unfavorable prognostic markers include 1p deletion, 11q deletion, and MYCN amplification. The overall survival for children with localized disease is 90%. The survival for children with metastatic disease is 45-60%. The current treatment for low-risk neuroblastoma is surgical resection followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. For intermediate-risk disease, the current standard is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. High-risk disease is treated with aggressive multimodality therapy including high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue. The role of myeloablative therapy followed by stem cell rescue is still being evaluated. The treatment plan for this patient includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy to make the tumor respectable and to treat micrometastatic disease. Surgical resection will follow chemotherapy, if possible, to reduce the tumor burden and to remove residual disease. The patient will then receive postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Without treatment, the disease will progress and metastasize, with a poor outcome.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
