    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents with eye dryness and a foreign body sensation in the eyes. On physical examination, the oral cavity shows mucosal ulceration and atrophy. Biopsy of the lower lip shows marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands. Which of the following is most likely seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody",
      "B": "Anti-centromere antibody",
      "C": "Anti-Jo-1 antibody",
      "D": "Anti-Scl-70 antibodies"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has Sjögren's syndrome, which is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands. The disease is associated with anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibodies, which are directed against the RNP antigens SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La). The sicca syndrome can be primary or secondary to other autoimmune disorders, such as RA, SLE, scleroderma, or vasculitis. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is associated with the HLA-DR3 haplotype and the presence of anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies. Anti-Jo-1 antibodies are seen in inflammatory myopathies. Anti-Scl-70 antibodies are seen in scleroderma. Anti-centromere antibodies are seen in limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome).\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
