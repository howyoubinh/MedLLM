    "question": "Ten days after undergoing a cadaveric renal transplant, a 21-year-old man has pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue. During the past 2 days, he has had decreasing urinary output. He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Recipient T-cells in the graft",
      "B": "Drug-induced nephrotoxicity",
      "C": "Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels",
      "D": "Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical scenario describes a patient with a renal transplant who has acute rejection. The rejection is manifested by a rise in serum creatinine, tenderness at the graft site, fever, and lethargy. The biopsy shows tubulitis, which is characteristic of an acute rejection. The most likely pathogenesis of this acute rejection is recipient T-cells in the graft, which are sensitized to the foreign (donor) HLA antigens. The C4d staining is negative, which indicates that there is no antibody-mediated rejection. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity is unlikely because the patient had a renal transplant 10 days prior to the symptoms. Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels is unlikely because the patient has a renal transplant, which is a glomerulopathy. Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies are unlikely because the patient had a renal transplant 10 days prior to the symptoms.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
