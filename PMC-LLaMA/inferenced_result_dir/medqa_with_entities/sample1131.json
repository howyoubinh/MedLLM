    "question": "A 78-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for sudden onset speech changes. The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Left frontal lobe",
      "B": "Left temporal lobe",
      "C": "Right frontal lobe",
      "D": "Right temporal lobe"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has expressive aphasia, which is caused by lesions of the dominant (usually left) hemisphere and is most often due to thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery. The middle cerebral artery supplies the entire lateral surface of the brain, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as the internal capsule. The patient's right-hand weakness is a consequence of the same lesion that caused the aphasia. A lesion of the left frontal lobe would cause a nonfluent aphasia. A lesion of the left temporal lobe would cause Wernicke's aphasia. A lesion of the right frontal lobe would cause a nonfluent aphasia. A lesion of the right temporal lobe would cause receptive aphasia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
