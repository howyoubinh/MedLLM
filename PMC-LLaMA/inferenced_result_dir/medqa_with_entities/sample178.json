    "question": "A 40-year-old businessman who was previously well is brought into the emergency department by his assistant with a complaint of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion",
      "B": "Right-sided Horner's syndrome",
      "C": "Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement",
      "D": "Right-sided analgesia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a central cord syndrome. The central cord syndrome results from damage to the gray matter nerve cells and crossing spinothalamic tracts surrounding the central canal. The central portion of the cord is impaired, and the peripheral portions are spared. This results in arm weakness out of proportion to leg weakness and a loss of pain and temperature sensation from the central portion of the body. Horner's syndrome is seen with lesions of the lateral medulla. The corticospinal tract is found in the lateral white matter of the spinal cord and would not be affected by a central cord lesion. Sensory loss for pain and temperature is found over the contralateral face with a lesion of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve in the pons.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
