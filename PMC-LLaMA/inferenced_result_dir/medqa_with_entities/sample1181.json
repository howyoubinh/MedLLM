    "question": "A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of excess hair growth on her face. Menses occur irregularly at 45 to 65-day intervals. She is 159 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2. Physical examination shows facial acne and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:\nSodium 141 mEq/L\nPotassium 4.2 mEq/L\nGlucose 109 mg/dL\nCortisol (1600 h) 4 μg/dL\nProlactin 14 ng/mL\n17-hydroxyprogesterone 390 ng/dL (N=20–300 ng/dL)\nTestosterone 91 ng/dL (N=8–60 ng/dL)\nA urine pregnancy test is negative. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells",
      "B": "Exogenous anabolic steroid use",
      "C": "Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles",
      "D": "Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's laboratory studies show hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and non-suppressible hyperandrogenism. The latter is manifested by elevated serum testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. The patient's irregular menses and hirsutism are consistent with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Theca interna cells in the ovaries of women with PCOS hyperproliferate, causing the stroma to become hyperthecotic. The presence of multiple cystic follicles in the ovaries of women with PCOS is characteristic. Theca interna cells are the major source of androgens in women with PCOS. These androgens cause the hirsutism and acne characteristic of PCOS. The elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone in women with PCOS are diagnostic. The elevated cortisol levels in women with PCOS are not diagnostic, but they may be associated with Cushing syndrome, which can cause hirsutism. The elevated cortisol levels in women with PCOS are secondary to the increased androgen levels, which stimulate adrenal cortical steroidogenesis. The elevated LH levels in women with PCOS are secondary to the increased androgen levels, which inhibit hypothalamic release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and suppress pituitary secretion of LH. The elevated LH levels in women with PCOS are not diagnostic. Exogenous anabolic steroid use can cause hirsutism and elevated testosterone levels, but it does not cause the elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels seen in PCOS.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
