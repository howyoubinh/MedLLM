    "question": "A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, and asthma presents to the primary care clinic today. She has tried several different statins, all of which have resulted in bothersome side effects. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, albuterol, oral contraceptives, and a multivitamin. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Her blood pressure is 116/82 mm Hg and her heart rate is 82/min. You decide to initiate colesevelam (Welchol). Of the following, which is a concern with the initiation of this medication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Colesevelam can cause cognitive impairment.",
      "B": "Colesevelam can increase the risk of cholelithiasis.",
      "C": "Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patientâ€™s other medications.",
      "D": "Colesevelam can significantly decrease your HDL."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. Colesevelam can increase the risk of cholelithiasis. Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant that binds bile acids in the intestine, thereby preventing their reabsorption. This leads to an increase in LDL receptor activity and a decrease in LDL levels. The decrease in LDL levels can lead to an increase in triglyceride levels. Colesevelam has no effect on HDL levels. The medication should be administered twice daily, usually with a meal. There are no significant drug interactions with colesevelam.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
