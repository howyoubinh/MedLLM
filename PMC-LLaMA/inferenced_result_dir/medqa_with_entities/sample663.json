He reports that he has a 15-year history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body. Motor strength is 5/5 and deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Perfusion of which of the following structures of the brain is most likely impaired in this patient?",

This structure contains the corticospinal and corticobulbar fibers, which are responsible for the motor deficit and hyperreflexia. The symptoms of this patient do not suggest involvement of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome), basal pons, ventral thalamus, or cerebellum.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
