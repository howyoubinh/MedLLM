    "question": "A 76-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents complaining of 3 weeks of cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion in the setting of a 20 pound weight loss. He is a 60 pack-year smoker, worked as a shipbuilder 30 years ago, and recently traveled to Ohio to visit family. Chest radiograph shows increased bronchovascular markings, reticular parenchymal opacities, and multiple pleural plaques. Labs are unremarkable except for a slight anemia. Which of the following is the most likely finding on this patient's chest CT?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nodular mass spreading along pleural surfaces",
      "B": "Honeycombing",
      "C": "Air bronchogram",
      "D": "Lower lobe cavitary mass"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is C. Air bronchogram. This patient has a typical presentation of a patient with pulmonary fibrosis. The CT scan will show a coarse, reticular pattern of linear and curvilinear opacities. Air bronchograms are commonly seen in pulmonary fibrosis. Honeycombing is a finding seen in patients with end-stage lung disease. Nodular masses that spread along the pleural surfaces are more typical of mesothelioma. Lower lobe cavitary masses are more typical of patients with cavitary tuberculosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
