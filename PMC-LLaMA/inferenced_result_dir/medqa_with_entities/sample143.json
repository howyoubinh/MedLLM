    "question": "A 68-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of painless hematuria. A CT scan of the urinary tract shows areas of bladder wall thickening. Cystoscopy shows several sessile masses with central necrosis arising from the bladder wall. A biopsy specimen of the bladder masses shows moderately differentiated urothelial cells with abundant mitotic figures and nuclear atypia. The patient most likely has a history of exposure to which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ionizing radiation",
      "B": "Aromatic amines",
      "C": "Aflatoxins",
      "D": "Radon"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient most likely has a history of exposure to aromatic amines, which are found in dyes, rubber, leather, paint, and cigarette smoke. These patients have a high risk of developing bladder cancer. Ionizing radiation can also be a risk factor, but this is less common. Aflatoxins are found in moldy grains and are a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Radon exposure is a risk factor for lung cancer.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
