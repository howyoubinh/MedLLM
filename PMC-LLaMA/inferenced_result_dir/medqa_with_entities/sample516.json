    "question": "A 59-year-old man presents to general medical clinic for his yearly checkup. He has no complaints except for a dry cough. He has a past medical history of type II diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and depression. His home medications are sitagliptin/metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, albuterol inhaler, and citalopram. His vitals signs are stable, with blood pressure 126/79 mmHg. Hemoglobin A1C is 6.3%, and creatinine is 1.3 g/dL. The remainder of his physical exam is unremarkable. If this patient's cough is due to one of the medications he is taking, what would be the next step in management?",

      "B": "Change lisinopril to amlodipine",
