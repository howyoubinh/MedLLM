    "question": "A 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 20 weeks of gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal exam. Her last pregnancy was unremarkable and she gave birth to a healthy rhesus (RhD) positive girl. Her past medical history is notable for a blood transfusion after a car accident with a complex femur fracture about 3 years ago. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. Examination shows that the uterus is at the umbilicus. Ultrasound examination reveals normal fetal heart rate, movement, and anatomy. Routine prenatal labs show the following:\nBlood type A Rh-\nLeukocyte count 11,000/mm3\nHemoglobin 12.5 g/dL\nPlatelet count 345,000/mm3\nSerum\nAnti-D antibody screen Negative\nRubella IgM Negative\nRubella IgG Negative\nVaricella IgM Negative\nVaricella IgG Positive\nSTD panel Negative\nUrine\nProtein Trace\nCulture No growth\nCervical cytology Normal\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.",
      "B": "Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks and administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks. No further management is needed.",
      "C": "No further screening is needed. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin shortly after delivery",
      "D": "No further management is needed\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "###Rationale: The patient is Rh-negative and has a history of a blood transfusion. She is currently at 20 weeks of gestation and has a positive varicella titer. The best next step in management is to administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive. The patient has a positive varicella titer, but this is not a contraindication to receiving the Rh(D) immunoglobulin. The patient had a blood transfusion in the past, but this is not a contraindication to receiving the Rh(D) immunoglobulin. The patient had a negative antibody screen at the beginning of the pregnancy, so no further screening is needed. The patient is not currently experiencing any complications, so no further management is needed.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
