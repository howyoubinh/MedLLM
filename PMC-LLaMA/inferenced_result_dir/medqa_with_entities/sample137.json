    "question": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of tearing and a foreign body sensation in her eyes bilaterally, which has gradually worsened over the last several weeks. She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 μU/mL and total T4 of 42 μg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient’s eye symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "External orbital radiation",
      "B": "Selenium supplementation",
      "C": "Systemic corticosteroids",
      "D": "Treatment with radioactive iodine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has Graves' ophthalmopathy, which is an autoimmune disorder that is part of the spectrum of Graves' disease. External orbital radiation can transiently worsen ophthalmopathy, presumably by increasing inflammation. Selenium supplementation has been tried as a treatment for ophthalmopathy, but the evidence for benefit is not strong. Systemic corticosteroids would be contraindicated, as they can precipitate hyperthyroidism. Treatment with radioactive iodine is the most common treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism and would also treat the ophthalmopathy. Thyroid surgery is another option for treating the hyperthyroidism and ophthalmopathy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
