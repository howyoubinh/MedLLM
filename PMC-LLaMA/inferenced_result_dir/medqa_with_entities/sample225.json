      "A": "Tinea versicolor",
      "B": "Albinism",

    }
  },
  "model_response": "The answer is B. Albinism. The absence of melanocytes in the epidermis is characteristic of albinism. Tinea versicolor is a superficial fungal infection of the skin that is usually not associated with an absence of melanocytes. Vitiligo is a disorder characterized by focal areas of depigmentation due to the loss of melanocytes. Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
