    "question": "A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening involuntary movements of both arms for the past 7 months. He reports that certain daily activities have become more difficult to perform. His father had a similar condition that was treated with medications. The patient appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a low-amplitude tremor bilaterally when the arms are outstretched that worsens when reaching out to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone is normal bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. On mental status examination, his mood is good. His speech is normal in rate and rhythm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Deep brain stimulation",
      "B": "Thalamotomy",
      "C": "Levodopa and carbidopa therapy",
      "D": "Propranolol therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical vignette describes a case of essential tremor, which is the most common movement disorder. The condition is usually familial and is characterized by a low-frequency tremor (5-8 Hz) that is most prominent in the upper extremities when they are in a position of postural maintenance or action. The condition is generally bilateral and symmetric. The differential diagnosis includes dystonic cranial-cervical tremor, which is usually a manifestation of a basal ganglia lesion, and physiologic tremor, which is generally higher in frequency (8-12 Hz) and is usually exacerbated by anxiety. Essential tremor is generally responsive to beta blockers, but the degree of improvement is highly variable. Levodopa is generally not effective. Thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation are reserved for severe, drug-resistant cases.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
