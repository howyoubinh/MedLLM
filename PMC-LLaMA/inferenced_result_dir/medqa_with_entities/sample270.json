    "question": "A 31-year-old female patient complains of numbness and tingling in her left hand, weakness, difficulty with walking, dizziness, and bladder dysfunction. She said that about a year ago, she had trouble with her vision, and that it eventually recovered in a few days. On physical exam, bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hyperreflexia in both patella, and bilateral clonus, are noted. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was done (Figure 1). If a lumbar puncture is performed in this patient, which of the following would most likely be found in cerebrospinal fluid analysis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Presence of 14-3-3 protein",
      "B": "Decreased glucose with neutrophilic predominance",
      "C": "Oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis",
      "D": "Decreased IgG CSF concentration"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical scenario and MRI findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). The most specific finding in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for MS is the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis. These bands are not specific for MS but indicate an inflammatory process in the central nervous system. The 14-3-3 protein is found in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Decreased glucose with neutrophilic predominance is found in bacterial meningitis. Decreased IgG CSF concentration is found in Guillain-Barre syndrome.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
