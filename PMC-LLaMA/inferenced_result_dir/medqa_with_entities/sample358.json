    "question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for an acute arm injury. The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient’s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Immobilization",
      "B": "Moderate flexion then hyperpronation",
      "C": "Radiograph",
      "D": "Supination then maximal extension"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The history and physical examination findings are consistent with a pulled elbow, also known as nursemaid's elbow. This is a subluxation of the radial head with or without a fracture. The patient is typically a young child, less than 5 years old, who is lifted by the wrist. The child suddenly stops and cries in pain. The arm is held in an attitude of pronation and extension. Radiographs are not necessary for the diagnosis, but may be obtained to rule out other diagnoses. Treatment consists of reduction of the subluxation by hyperpronation followed by flexion. This maneuver most often reduces the subluxation and relieves the pain. If pain persists, the patient should be splinted with the elbow in flexion and the forearm in supination.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
