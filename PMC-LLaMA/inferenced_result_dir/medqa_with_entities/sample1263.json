    "question": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of difficulties walking for the past year. He has had multiple falls over the past 4 months. Over the past 6 months, he has had progressive urinary urgency and now wears an adult diaper as is not always able to control the urge to void. His appetite has also decreased in this time period. He used to drive, but his wife convinced him to stop after she noticed that he was becoming increasingly inattentive while driving. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medications include ramipril and metformin. His temperature is 37.1C (98.8F), pulse is 90/min and blood pressure is 132/88 mm Hg. Examination shows a broad-based gait with slow and short steps. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. On mental status examination, he is oriented to person and place but not to time. Attention and concentration are impaired. He recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ventricular shunting",
      "B": "Acetazolamide therapy",
      "C": "Temporal lobectomy",
      "D": "Donepezil therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A (Ventricular shunting). This patient has a presentation consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus. This is a communicating hydrocephalus with a triad of gait disturbance, dementia and urinary incontinence. The ventricles are typically enlarged on imaging studies. Ventricular shunting can be very effective in treating this condition. Acetazolamide therapy is sometimes used for pseudotumor cerebri, but this condition is typically associated with a headache and papilledema. Temporal lobectomy is used in the treatment of medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Donepezil therapy is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia.\n\n### ADDITIONAL READING ON NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS\n\nThe term \"normal pressure hydrocephalus\" (NPH) is somewhat of a misnomer as intracranial pressure is usually elevated in these patients. The term \"communicating hydrocephalus\" is more accurate as it denotes the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. NPH is presumed to be caused by obstruction to normal flow of CSF over the cerebral convexities and delayed absorption into the venous system. The CSF opening pressure is in the high normal range (HNP) or marginally elevated (MEN) range. NPH is most commonly caused by chronic meningitis (e.g. tuberculous meningitis) or subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nThe classic clinical triad of NPH consists of an abnormal gait (ataxic or apractic), dementia and urinary incontinence. Neuroimaging typically shows enlarged lateral ventricles but may be normal in up to 20% of cases. CSF studies may show mildly elevated protein and lymphocytic leukocytosis. Ventricular shunting can be very effective in treating this condition.\n\n### ADDITIONAL READING ON PSEUDO-TUMOR CEREBRI\n\nPseudotumor cerebri is a condition that is characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) without an identifiable cause. The most common causes of pseudotumor cerebri are high doses of vitamin A, outdated tetracycline, quinolones, amiodarone, nalidixic acid, isotretinoin, and iron. Other causes include metabolic disorders such as hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism, renal failure, SLE, and Behcet's disease. Pseudotumor cerebri can also be seen in young women, especially those who are obese.\n\nThe most common symptom of pseudotumor cerebri is headache, usually worse in the morning. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, transient visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus, diplopia, and sixth nerve palsy. Examination findings include papilledema, enlarged blind spot, and visual field defects. Neuroimaging shows mildly enlarged ventricles and an empty sella. CSF studies show an opening pressure in the high normal range (HNP) or marginally elevated (MEN) range.\n\nTreatment of pseudotumor cerebri includes medical therapy (acetazolamide, serial lumbar punctures, and high-dose vitamin A) and surgical therapy (optic nerve sheath fenestration, lumbar puncture, and ventricular shunting).\n\n### ADDITIONAL READING ON MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY\n\nMedial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common syndrome associated with focal seizures with dyscognitive features. The most common etiology of MTLE is mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). MTS is characterized by neuronal loss, gliosis, and atrophy of the mesial temporal lobe. The most common clinical features of MTS include focal seizures with dyscognitive features, ict",
