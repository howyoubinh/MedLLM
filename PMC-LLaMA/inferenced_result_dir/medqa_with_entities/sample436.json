    "question": "A 3-year-old male is brought in to his pediatrician by his mother because she is concerned that he is not growing appropriately. Physical examination is notable for frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities. His axial skeleton appears normal. He is at the 7th percentile for height and 95th percentile for head circumference. He demonstrates normal intelligence and is able to speak in three-word sentences. He first sat up without support at twelve months and started walking at 24 months. Genetic analysis reveals an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor. Which of the following physiologic processes is most likely disrupted in this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Intramembranous ossification",
      "B": "Osteoblast maturation",
      "C": "Endochondral ossification",
      "D": "Production of type I collagen"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s condition is consistent with a diagnosis of achondroplasia, which is caused by activating mutations in the FGFR3 gene. FGFR3 is a negative regulator of endochondral ossification, which is the process by which most of the skeleton is formed. In this process, mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes, which produce a cartilaginous template that is replaced by bone during development. Intramembranous ossification, which is the direct conversion of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts, is not disrupted in this condition. Osteoblast maturation, which is the process by which osteoblasts differentiate from mesenchymal cells, is not disrupted in this condition. Type I collagen production, which is the major component of bone and cailage, is not disrupted in this condition.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
