    "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a headache. She has had episodic headaches like this in the past and states that her headache today is severe, worse when laying down, and not responding to ibuprofen. She also reports a transient episode of vision loss and current blurry vision. She states she has a ringing in her ears as well. The patient has a past medical history of headaches, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 149/92 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is not remarkable and an initial head CT is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management for the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ibuprofen",
      "B": "Lumbar puncture",
      "C": "MRI",
      "D": "Tissue plasminogen activator"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. Lumbar puncture. This patient's presentation is most consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This condition is most common in obese women of childbearing age. It is characterized by headache, visual changes, and occasionally hearing changes. It is often associated with an elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture, but the cerebrospinal fluid is usually normal. The condition is thought to be due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption. The diagnosis is clinical, but an elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture can support the diagnosis. The initial treatment is with acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that decreases the formation of cerebrospinal fluid. If the patient does not respond to acetazolamide or if the patient's symptoms are severe, lumbar puncture can lower intracranial pressure. The other answer choices are not appropriate for this patient. Ibuprofen would not be effective for this patient's symptoms. MRI is not likely to provide additional information for this patient's symptoms. Tissue plasminogen activator is used for acute stroke and would not be appropriate for this patient.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
