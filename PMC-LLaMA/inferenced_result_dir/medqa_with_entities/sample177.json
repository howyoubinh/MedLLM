    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to a rheumatologist with bilateral wrist and knee pain that has been present for the last 10 years. The patient was a professional athlete who retired at age 50. He also notes morning stiffness in his joints that lasts approx. 50 minutes. He denies joint swelling, color changes in his digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills. On physical exam, the physician notes several non-tender nodules on the left 1st, 3rd, and 4th distal interphalangeal joints. There is also tenderness with palpation at the base of both thumbs. The patient’s knees are enlarged, bilaterally, and he has pain and crepitus on passive range of motion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ankylosing spondylitis",
      "B": "Gout",
      "C": "Osteoarthritis",
      "D": "Fibromyalgia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation is most consistent with osteoarthritis. He is an older man with a history of joint pain and swelling, with morning stiffness. The distribution of joint involvement is typical for osteoarthritis, with the DIP and PIP joints of the hands and the knees being the most commonly affected joints. The non-tender Heberden’s and Bouchard’s nodes are classic for osteoarthritis. The first CMC joint is also commonly involved in osteoarthritis. The spine is not involved in osteoarthritis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
