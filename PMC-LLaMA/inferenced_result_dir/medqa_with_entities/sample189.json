    "question": "A 17-year-old woman presents to your office concerned that she has not had her menstrual period in 4 months. She states that menses began at age of 13 and has been regular until two months ago. She denies sexual activity, and urine pregnancy test is negative. On exam, she appears well-nourished with a BMI of 21 kg/m^2, but you note that she has enlarged cheeks bilaterally and has calluses on the dorsum of her hands. She says that she has been very stressed with school and has recently been binge eating. What other finding do you expect to see in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Malar rash",
      "B": "Increased blood glucose level",
      "C": "Erosion of tooth enamel",
      "D": "Elevated estrogen levels"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has the constellation of findings that suggest the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. This disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by attempts to purge calories through self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, or excessive exercise. The result of these activities is a cycle of weight fluctuation that leads to an obsession with weight and body image. The physical exam findings of calluses on the dorsum of the hand are a result of the patient's attempt to induce vomiting by putting her fingers into her mouth and forcibly gagging herself. The enlarged cheeks are due to enlargement of the parotid glands from repeated episodes of sore, inflamed glands due to the patient's self-induced vomiting. The erosion of tooth enamel is due to the excessive exposure of the teeth to stomach acid during repeated vomiting. The malar rash is a characteristic rash seen in patients with bulimia that results from the repeated exposure of the face to the acidic gastric juices during vomiting. The increased blood glucose level is not a feature of this disorder. The elevated estrogen levels are not seen in patients with bulimia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
