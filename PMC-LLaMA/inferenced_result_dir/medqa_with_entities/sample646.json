    "question": "A 53-year-old female patient comes to the physician’s office for her annual check-up visit. She has no complaints and her past medical history is notable for diabetes and hypertension. During this visit, the patient undergoes screening procedures per guidelines including a mammogram. On the screening mammogram a spiculated, irregular mass is found on the left breast. Further diagnostic mammography and biopsy reveal ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Which of the following is the most important factor in determining this patient’s prognosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tumor grade",
      "B": "Tumor stage",
      "C": "Age",
      "D": "Location of the tumor on the breast"
    }

  "model_response": "The most important factor in determining the prognosis of a patient with breast cancer is tumor stage. The TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) staging system is used. This system takes into account the size of the tumor (T), the involvement of regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastases (M). The patient's age and location of the tumor on the breast are important but are less critical than the stage. Tumor grade is also important but is less critical than stage.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
