    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for “growing pains,” but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Osteosarcoma",
      "B": "Osteochondroma",
      "C": "Ewing sarcoma",
      "D": "Osteoid osteoma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most common primary malignant bone tumor in children is osteosarcoma. The classic clinical presentation is pain at rest that is worse at night and is not relieved by anti-inflammatory agents. The painful \"growing pain\" in this case was caused by the tumor irritating the periosteum. The swelling and subsequent tenderness resulted from a hematoma from a bleed into the bone and soft tissue. The radiograph shows characteristic evidence of bone destruction and new bone formation. The biopsy shows small round blue cells, which is characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. Osteochondroma is a benign bone tumor that appears as a bump on the bone. Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor that presents with pain that is relieved by aspirin. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that presents with pain and a characteristic chromosomal translocation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
