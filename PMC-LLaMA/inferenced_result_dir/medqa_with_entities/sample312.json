    "question": "A 68-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a 7-month history of fatigue and low back pain. Her pain is not improved by over the counter analgesics. Laboratory analysis is notable for a calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen level of 30 mg/dL. Large eosinophilic casts are seen on renal biopsy. Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen on peripheral blood smear?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Abundant reticulocytes",
      "B": "Linear aggregations of red blood cells",
      "C": "Schistocytes",
      "D": "Leukocytosis with abundant mature myeloid cells"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The answer is A: Abundant reticulocytes: This patient has multiple myeloma, as evidenced by the presence of eosinophilic casts on renal biopsy. The renal failure is due to hypercalcemia, which is a common complication of myeloma. The combination of renal failure and anemia leads to a high reticulocyte count. The anemia is normocytic and normochromic. The peripheral blood smear will show many newly formed red blood cells (reticulocytes) due to the marked increase in erythropoiesis. The other choices are not characteristic of multiple myeloma.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
