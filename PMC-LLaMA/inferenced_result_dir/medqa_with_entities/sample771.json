    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a motor vehicle accident. He is unconscious upon arrival and is found to have severe internal bleeding due to trauma. He is taken for emergency surgery and severely damaged tissues are removed. After surgery, the boy is taken into the PICU for recovery. Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge. Which of the following is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case?",
    "options": {
      "A": "30S ribosome inhibitor",
      "B": "50S ribosome inhibitor",
      "C": "Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor",
      "D": "DNA gyrase inhibitor"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient was most likely prescribed Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2); Nuclear factor 2 (NF-2) or NF-2 p45 subunit inhibitors, which are used to prevent and treat cytotoxic drug-induced toxicities, particularly in the case of carboplatin and cisplatin. These drugs are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and target cell counts. The mechanism of action of these drugs is to prevent the transcription of nuclear factor genes, which are necessary for DNA synthesis. These factors are not directly related to the replication of the cell's genome. The 30S ribosome inhibitors (such as streptogramins and macrolide antibiotics) inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. The 50S ribosome inhibitors (such as the aminoglycosides) inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. The cell wall cross-linking inhibitors (such as the beta-lactam antibiotics) prevent the cross-linking of the cell wall, which is necessary for the outward pressure that keeps the cell rigid. The DNA gyrase inhibitors (such as the fluoroquinolones) prevent the resealing of the cut DNA strands after the DNA has been replicated.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
