    "question": "A 38-year-old woman undergoes a partial thyroidectomy for an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness. What could be the most likely cause of her hoarseness?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Internal laryngeal nerve injury",
      "B": "Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury",
      "C": "External laryngeal nerve injury",
      "D": "Laryngeal edema"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates all intrinsic muscles of the larynx, with the exception of the cricothyroid muscle. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle. The inferior thyroid arteries are located near the poles of the thyroid gland and are at risk of being ligated during thyroidectomy. The recurrent laryngeal nerve runs near the inferior thyroid arteries and can be injured during ligation of these vessels. The symptoms of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury include hoarseness and paralysis of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. The cricothyroid muscle is responsible for tensing the vocal cords, thus increasing pitch during speech. Paralysis of this muscle would result in a decrease in vocal cord tension and a lower pitch during speech. The internal laryngeal nerve is a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and supplies sensory innervation to the larynx above the vocal cords. The external laryngeal nerve is a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and supplies sensory innervation to the larynx below the vocal cords. Laryngeal edema would present with stridor and difficulty breathing.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
