    "question": "The Kozak sequence for the Beta-globin gene has a known mutation which decreases, though does not abolish, translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. What would the blood smear be expected to show in a patient positive for this mutation?",
    "options": {

  "model_response": "The Kozak sequence is a sequence of nucleotides in the 5' untranslated region of mRNA that affects the efficiency of translation into protein. The Kozak sequence for the Beta-globin gene has a mutation which decreases, though does not abolish, translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. The mutation is a G to C mutation, which changes the consensus sequence from GCCAAA to GCCACAA. This mutation is expected to disrupt the consensus sequence, leading to a decrease in translation of the Beta-globin mRNA. This would lead to a decrease in the amount of Beta-globin protein produced, and thus a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. Thalassemia intermedia is a condition in which the red blood cells are larger than normal (macrocytic), but not as large as in thalassemia major. The blood smear would be expected to show macrocytic red blood cells. Bite cells are seen in iron deficiency anemia. Microcytic red blood cells are seen in iron deficiency anemia, beta-thalassemia, and anemia of chronic disease. Hyperchromic red blood cells are seen in conditions such as lead poisoning.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Most eukaryotic mRNAs have a sequence of polyadenylic acid at the 3' end, referred to as the poly(A) tail. The function of this tail is not known for certain, but it may play a role in the export of mature mRNA from the nucleus as well as in helping stabilize some mRNA molecules by retarding their degradation in the cytoplasm."
