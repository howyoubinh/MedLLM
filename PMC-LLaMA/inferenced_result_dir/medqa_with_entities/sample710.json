    "question": "A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine. He reports alternating episodes of decreased urine output followed by a temporary increase in urine output for the past 2 days. In the past year, he has had two urinary tract infections. He has Crohn disease and underwent a small bowel resection 5 years ago. He currently takes mesalamine and a multivitamin. His father had recurrent kidney stones. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows 70 RBC/hpf and envelope-shaped crystals. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patientâ€™s current condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Parathyroid gland adenoma",
      "B": "Excess vitamin D",
      "C": "Malabsorption of fatty acids",
      "D": "High urine pH"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The recurrent urinary tract infections suggest that the patient has some form of urinary tract obstruction. The alternating episodes of oliguria and polyuria are typical of partial obstruction. The presence of crystals in the urine suggests that the patient has a urinary tract stone. The presence of a stone in the ureter and two smaller stones in the kidney further support this diagnosis. The most common cause of nephrolithiasis is idiopathic hypercalciuria. This disorder is most likely due to a defect in renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. This defect can be caused by a defect in the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid gland, leading to hyperparathyroidism. A parathyroid adenoma could cause increased renal reabsorption of calcium and increased urinary excretion of calcium, leading to stone formation. A high-calcium diet can also lead to an increased risk of stone formation. Excess vitamin D can result in increased intestinal absorption of calcium, leading to hypercalcemia and increased risk of stone formation. Malabsorption of fatty acids can lead to a decrease in the amount of bile salts in the bile, which would decrease the solubility product of calcium and thus increase the risk of stone formation. A high urinary pH would increase the solubility of uric acid and thus decrease the risk of stone formation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
