    "question": "A 43-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after his son found him vomiting bright red blood. He is visibly intoxicated, and hospital records indicate a long history of alcohol substance abuse treated with antabuse (disulfiram). Vital signs include T 98.4, HR 89, BP 154/92, and RR 20. EGD is notable for mild esophagitis, and a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, with no active bleeding. What is the next best course of action?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding, IV fluid hydration, and NPO",
      "B": "Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation",
      "C": "Esophageal manometry and impedance studies",
      "D": "Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The next best course of action is A. Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding, IV fluid hydration, and NPO. The patient has a Mallory-Weiss tear, which is a longitudinal tear in the gastroesophageal junction that is the source of his bleeding. The treatment is usually conservative, with IV fluids to maintain his volume status, NPO to prevent further irritation of the esophagus, and possibly observation in the ICU if he is hemodynamically unstable. Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding is a treatment for variceal bleeding, not Mallory-Weiss tears. Esophageal manometry and impedance studies are used to evaluate disorders of esophageal motility, such as achalasia and diffuse esophageal spasm. Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter are treatments for esophageal spasm, not Mallory-Weiss tears.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
