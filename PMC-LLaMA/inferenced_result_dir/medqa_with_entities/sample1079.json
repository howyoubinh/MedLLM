    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision. The diplopia is more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze. He denies having fever, headache, ocular pain, lacrimation, changes in color vision, or limb weakness. He has a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, he had an ischemic stroke 9 years ago, from which he recovered completely with physiotherapy and rehabilitation. He has a history of a 56-pack-year cigarette smoking habit. His medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, glimepiride, metformin, metoprolol, and ramipril. The mental status examination is unremarkable. His muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs. His sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face. The examination of extraocular movements is shown in the image. A lesion in which of the following locations explains the findings during eye examination?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cavernous sinus",
      "B": "Corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation",
      "C": "Frontal eye field",
      "D": "Medial longitudinal fasciculus"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a left-sided internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is due to a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). MLF connects the cranial nerve nuclei III, IV, and VI. INO is characterized by ipsilateral impaired adduction of one eye (due to damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus) and contralateral impaired abduction of the other eye (due to damage to the corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation). The cavernous sinus contains cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2, and VI, but a lesion in this location would not explain the blurring of vision and diplopia on left-sided lateral gaze. The frontal eye field is responsible for voluntary eye movements, but a lesion in this location would not explain the blurring of vision and diplopia on left-sided lateral gaze. The corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation is responsible for voluntary limb movements, but a lesion in this location would not explain the blurring of vision and diplopia on left-sided lateral gaze.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Any imprint and/or symbol should be clearly identifiable, and the viewer should not normally need to rotate the image in order to read it. Images that are submitted with SPL should be included in the same directory as the SPL file."
