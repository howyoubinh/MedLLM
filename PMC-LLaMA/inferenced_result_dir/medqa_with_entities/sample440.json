    "question": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of persistent bleeding from his nose over the past hour. The bleeding started spontaneously. He has no history of a similar episode. He takes no medications. There is no history of abnormal bleeding in the family. His vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, he is pressing a gauze against his left nostril while hyperextending his head. The gauze is stained with blood and upon withdrawal of the gauze blood slowly drips out of his left nostrils. There is no bleeding from the right nostril. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Anterior packing and topical antibiotics",
      "B": "Oxymetazoline nasal spray",
      "C": "Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril",
      "D": "Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has epistaxis. The most common cause of epistaxis in the pediatric population is idiopathic. The most common cause of epistaxis in adults is trauma. The most common site of epistaxis is the Woodruff area, which is the Little's area, or the site of the Kiesselbach plexus, which is the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum. Initial therapy for epistaxis includes the application of an anesthetic vasoconstrictor such as oxymetazoline. If this therapy is unsuccessful, anterior packing with a topical antibiotic ointment is the next step. If this therapy is unsuccessful, anterior nasal packing with a posterior nasal spray of a vasoconstrictor and topical antibiotic may be necessary. If this therapy is unsuccessful, the patient may require cauterization of the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
