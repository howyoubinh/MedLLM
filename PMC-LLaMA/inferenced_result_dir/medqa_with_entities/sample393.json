    "question": "A 29-year-old G1P0 woman is giving birth at 38 weeks gestation to a  boy via vaginal delivery. As soon as the infant is clear of the vagina, a congenital malformation of the abdomen is observed. The infant is removed from the delivery room for further evaluation. Visual inspection shows loops of intestine protruding out of his abdomen on the right side. His APGAR scores are 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. His heart rate is 125/min, and his respirations are 45/min. All reflexes appear normal. There are no other visible defects. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Wrap the intestines in a sterile bowel bag",
      "B": "Transfer the newborn to the NICU",
      "C": "Start IV fluids",
      "D": "Transfer the newborn for immediate surgery"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The infant should be transferred for immediate surgery. The description is classic for gastroschisis, which is a defect in the abdominal wall through which the intestinal contents protrude. The defect is usually to the right of an intact umbilical cord. Unlike omphalocele, which is a defect in the abdominal wall covered by a sac, gastroschisis is an emergent situation because the intestines are exposed to the amnios and can become contaminated. The risk of infection is high. The intestines should be carefully wrapped in a sterile bowel bag to reduce contamination during transport. IV fluids are not indicated because there is no evidence of circulatory compromise. There is no need to transfer the newborn to the NICU or to perform a cesarean section.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
