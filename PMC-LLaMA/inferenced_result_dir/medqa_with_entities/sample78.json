    "question": "A newborn is found to be extremely cyanotic immediately after birth. He then develops progressive respiratory failure and is admitted to the neonatal ICU. A single loud S2 heart sound is appreciated as well as a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. Radiography shows an enlarged \"egg-shaped\" heart. The newborn is then taken for a atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this newborn's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Coarctation of the aorta",
      "B": "Persistent truncus arteriosus",
      "C": "Transposition of great vessels",
      "D": "Tricuspid atresia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The newborn is likely suffering from transposition of the great vessels. Transposition of the great vessels is a cyanotic congenital heart defect in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. This results in complete separation of the systemic and pulmonary circulations. Since systemic and pulmonary circulations are separate, survival depends on mixing of oxygenated pulmonary blood and deoxygenated systemic blood, which can occur at the atrial level via an atrial septal defect or at the ventricular level via a patent ductus arteriosus.
