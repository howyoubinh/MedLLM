    "question": "A previously healthy 19-year-old man comes to the physician with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours. He has also had a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days. He has not had urethral discharge. He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf. A Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection",
      "B": "Testicular tumor",
      "C": "Chlamydia trachomatis infection",
      "D": "Varicocele"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's presentation is most consistent with epididymitis, an inflammation of the epididymis. The most common cause of epididymitis in sexually active men younger than 35 years is sexually transmitted organisms, particularly Chlamydia trachomatis. The increased blood flow seen on testicular ultrasound is a common finding in epididymitis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae can cause urethritis, but not epididymitis. Testicular tumors are uncommon in young men, and the presentation is not consistent with a tumor. Varicocele is an abnormal dilation of the veins draining the testicle, resulting in a swollen, tender testicle. This condition is most common on the left side.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
