    "question": "A 70-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department after 3 days of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower limb edema. His personal history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 years ago that required revascularization and hypertension. His medication consists of simvastatin and lisinopril.  In the ED, he has a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a pulse of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical examination, he has jugular vein distention, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), an S4-gallop, a holosystolic murmur, and 2+ pitting edema up to the mid calf.  He is started on furosemide, carvedilol, and oxygen therapy. After 6-hours of continued therapy, his blood pressure remains low, and his serum creatinine is found to be 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sulfosalicylic acid test",
      "B": "Urine sodium content",
      "C": "Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea)",
      "D": "Nitrates in urine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is calculated as:\n\nFeNa = (urine Na x serum creatinine) / (serum Na x urinary creatinine) x 100\n\nThe FeNa is helpful in differentiating prerenal azotemia (which has a low urinary sodium because of the action of angiotensin II) from intrinsic renal azotemia (which has a high urinary sodium because of tubular damage).\n\nA value below 1% suggests prerenal azotemia; a value above 2% suggests intrinsic renal azotemia.\n\nThe other tests listed are used primarily in the diagnosis of obstructive uropathy.\n\nThe sulfosalicylic acid test measures the ability of the kidney to excrete a filtered load of sulfosalicylic acid. A load of 25 mg of sulfosalicylic acid is given and the urine and serum are collected at 1 and 3 hours. The test is positive if the urinary excretion of sulfosalicylic acid is less than 40% of the filtered load in 3 hours. This test is rarely used because it is cumbersome to perform and has been superseded by the creatinine clearance.\n\nThe urine sodium content is useful in differentiating between prerenal azotemia and intrinsic renal azotemia. In prerenal azotemia, the urine sodium content is below 20 mEq/L because of the effect of angiotensin II to enhance sodium reabsorption. In intrinsic renal azotemia, the urine sodium content is above 40 mEq/L because of tubular damage and the inability to reabsorb sodium.\n\nThe urine specific gravity is useful in differentiating between prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis. In prerenal azotemia, the urine specific gravity is above 1.015 because of the effect of angiotensin II to enhance water reabsorption. In acute tubular necrosis, the urine specific gravity is below 1.010 because of the inability of the tubules to reabsorb water.\n\nThe urine osmolality is useful in differentiating between prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis. In prerenal azotemia, the urine osmolality is above 500 mOsm/kg because of the effect of angiotensin II to enhance water reabsorption. In acute tubular necrosis, the urine osmolality is below 350 mOsm/kg because of the inability of the tubules to reabsorb water.\n\nThe urine protein/creatinine ratio is useful in differentiating between prerenal azotemia and acute glomerulonephritis. In prerenal azotemia, the urine protein/creatinine ratio is below 0.2 because of the effect of angiotensin II to enhance the proximal tubular reabsorption of proteins. In acute glomerulonephritis, the urine protein/creatinine ratio is above 0.5 because of the loss of glomerular filtration barrier function.\n\nThe nitrates in urine test is useful in differentiating between prerenal azotemia and acute glomerulonephritis. In prerenal azotemia, the urinary excretion of nitrates is below 20 mg/day because of the effect of angiotensin II to enhance the proximal tubular reabsorption of nitrates. In acute glomerulonephritis, the urinary excretion of nitrates is above 200 mg/day because of the loss of glomerular filtration barrier function.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
