    "question": "A 64-year-old man with coronary artery disease and hypertension comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. His blood pressure ranged from 160/100 mm Hg to 150/94 mm Hg on his previous 3 visits over the past 4 months. Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. Three weeks ago, he was also started on amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 158/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Renal duplex ultrasonography shows 90% occlusion of the right renal artery. Decreased renal blood flow is most likely to cause which of the following?",
