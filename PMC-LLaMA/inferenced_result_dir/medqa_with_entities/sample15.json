    "question": "A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acute cholecystitis",
      "B": "Gallbladder cancer",
      "C": "Choledocholithiasis",
      "D": "Pancreatitis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most common complication of gallstones is acute cholecystitis. However, in this patient, the presence of a calcified mass near the gallbladder should raise concern for gallbladder cancer. The risk factors for gallbladder cancer include gallstones, age greater than 60, and chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. The calcified mass seen in this patient is most likely a calcified gallbladder, also known as a porcelain gallbladder. The other risk factors for gallbladder cancer include primary sclerosis cholangitis, choledochal cysts, and obesity.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
