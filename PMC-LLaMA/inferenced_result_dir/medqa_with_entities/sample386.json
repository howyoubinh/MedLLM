    "question": "A 28-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care physician with increased menstrual bleeding over the past three months. She also notes easy bruising and bleeding from her gums when brushing her teeth. She is sexually active with multiple partners and has no history of intravenous drug use. Physical exam is remarkable for petechiae and scattered ecchymoses on the patient's bilateral upper and lower extremities. Urine beta-HCG is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Hgb 13.0 g/dL, WBCs 6,000/mL, platelets 95,000/mL, PT 13.2s, aPTT 30s. Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities. Which diagnostic study should be performed next?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Serum factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity",
      "B": "Measurement of ADAMTS13 activity",
      "C": "HIV and HCV testing",
      "D": "Bone marrow aspiration"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A. Serum factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity. This patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The most common form of ITP is acquired ITP, which is autoimmune mediated. The diagnostic workup of acquired ITP should include measurement of serum levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor activity to rule out an underlying congenital clotting disorder. Other tests to consider include HIV and HCV testing, which are negative in this case, and a bone marrow aspiration, which is not indicated at this time. The patient's clinical presentation is not consistent with a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease. Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder that occurs exclusively in males. von Willebrand disease is usually diagnosed in childhood and is associated with a prolonged bleeding time and a positive family history.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
