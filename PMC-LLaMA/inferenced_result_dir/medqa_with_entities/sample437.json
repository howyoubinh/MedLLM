    "question": "A 59-year-old woman comes to the physician 2 weeks after noticing a lump in her left breast. Examination of the left breast shows a firm, nontender mass close to the nipple. Mammography shows an irregular calcified mass. A core needle biopsy shows invasive ductal carcinoma. Genetic analysis of this patient's cancer cells is most likely to show overexpression of which of the following genes?",

      "A": "HER2",

  "model_response": "The overexpression of the HER2 gene is associated with a poor prognosis. The BCR-ABL translocation is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The BRCA-2 gene is associated with familial breast cancer. The BCL-2 gene is associated with the development of follicular lymphoma.
