    "question": "A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough for the last week. Three weeks ago, he had a fever and a cough for 6 days after he returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. He has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. He has bronchial asthma and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 41 years. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler and enalapril. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/89 mm Hg. There is dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",
