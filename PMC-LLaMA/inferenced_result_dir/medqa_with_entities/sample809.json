    "question": "A 16-year-old teenager presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain in his right knee. He describes the pain as the worst pain he has ever felt. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the knee. The joint appears red and swollen and is hot to the touch. He denies any lower extremity numbness. There is no family history of joint or connective tissue disorders. The teenager is otherwise healthy. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, respirations are 17/min, pulse is 104/min, and temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). On palpation of the affected joint, there is evidence of tenderness and capsular swelling; the joint is red and warm. Laboratory studies show increased serum CRP and procalcitonin levels. Which of the following will most likely found with analysis of his synovial fluid?",
    "options": {
      "A": "WBC/mm3 1,600; % PMN > 25%; Viscosity N",
      "B": "WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low",
      "C": "WBC/mm3 160; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity high",
      "D": "WBC/mm3 2,400; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity low"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The synovial fluid analysis shows a high level of neutrophils, indicating an acute inflammatory process. The high level of neutrophils (> 75%) indicates a bacterial infection. The low viscosity indicates the fluid is not too thick or too thin. The most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis. The next step is to determine the offending organism.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
