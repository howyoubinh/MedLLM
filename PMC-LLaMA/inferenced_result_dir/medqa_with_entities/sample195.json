    "question": "A group of researchers conducted a study to determine whether there is an association between folic acid supplementation before pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers with children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers with healthy children. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01). Which of the following type of bias is most likely to have influenced these results?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Interviewer bias",
      "B": "Latency period",
      "C": "Recall bias",
      "D": "Survival bias"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is C. Recall bias. Recall bias occurs when cases and controls misreport past events, usually in a direction that is related to the outcome of interest. In this case, mothers of children with ASD may have been more likely to remember taking folic acid because it is recommended for fetal brain development. This type of bias is known as recall bias. Interviewer bias is unlikely to have influenced the results because interviewers were blind to the study hypothesis. The latency period is the time between exposure to a risk factor and the manifestation of a disease. In this case, the study did not have a latency period because the exposure (folic acid supplementation) and outcome (ASD) were both assessed at the same time. Survival bias occurs when the survival of patients with a disease influences the detection of that disease. This type of bias is not applicable to this study because the outcome (ASD) was assessed in both groups at the same time.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
