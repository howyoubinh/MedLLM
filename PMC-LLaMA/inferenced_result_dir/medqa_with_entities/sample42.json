    "question": "A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Duodenal atresia",
      "B": "Meconium ileus",
      "C": "Necrotizing enterocolitis",
      "D": "Pyloric stenosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation of a one-day-old male with bilious vomiting, hypoactive bowel sounds, and abdominal distention raises concern for a congenital gastrointestinal anomaly. The patient’s history of decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) on quadruple screen, along with the associated risk factors of gestational diabetes and advanced maternal age, raises concern for a possible underlying genetic syndrome. The patient’s siblings being healthy does not rule out the possibility of an underlying genetic syndrome. Duodenal atresia is the most common cause of duodenal obstruction in a full-term newborn. It is associated with polyhydramnios, premature birth, and twinning. The classic plain abdominal radiograph of duodenal atresia is termed the double-bubble sign (gas in the stomach and duodenal bulb). Meconium ileus is a manifestation of cystic fibrosis and is characterized by abdominal distention, failure to pass meconium, and a family history of cystic fibrosis. Meconium ileus is usually diagnosed in the neonatal period, but it may present later in childhood. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating condition that primarily affects premature infants. It is characterized by a triad of abdominal distention, bloody stools, and lethargy. Pyloric stenosis is a congenital anomaly that classically presents in the first few weeks of life. Infants with pyloric stenosis develop projectile postprandial vomiting that eventually leads to hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
