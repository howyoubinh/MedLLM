    "question": "A 47-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who is undergoing chemotherapy comes to the physician for a follow-up exam. She reports extreme fatigue since beginning her chemotherapy regimen. Her pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg. Her hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL, leukocyte count is 800/mm3 with 5% monocytes, and platelet count is 50,000/mm3. The patient is started on a new medication. One week later, serum studies show a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3 with 2% monocytes, and a platelet count of 56,000/mm3. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Aldesleukin",
      "B": "Interferon beta",
      "C": "Filgrastim",
      "D": "Romiplostim"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has chemotherapy-induced anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia that is being treated with filgrastim, a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The drug stimulates the bone marrow to increase neutrophil production. The increase in neutrophils is accompanied by an increase in monocytes. The drug has no effect on platelet production. Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin mimetic that is used in the treatment of thrombocytopenia. Aldesleukin is a recombinant form of interleukin-2 used in the treatment of malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Interferon beta is used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
