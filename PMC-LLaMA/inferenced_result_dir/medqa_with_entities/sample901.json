    "question": "A 27-year-old G3P1010 makes an appointment with her gynecologist for evaluation of profuse bleeding, which began two days ago. She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Antibiotics",
      "B": "Magnesium sulfate",
      "C": "Methotrexate",
      "D": "Dilation and curettage"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient is experiencing a threatened abortion. She has bleeding and crampy abdominal pain, but no cervical dilatation or effacement. The initial treatment is conservative, consisting of rest, sedation, and hydration. If the pregnancy does not stabilize, then consideration is given to more aggressive management, such as administration of intramuscular beta-agonist, use of mineral oil as a cervical lubricant, and/or curettage. If the pregnancy continues to be threatened, then consideration is given to use of antibiotics, coagulation defects, and/or autoimmune disease. If the pregnancy is inevitably doomed, then the uterus is evacuated. Magnesium sulfate is used in the treatment of preeclampsia. Methotrexate is used in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

They can also be worn by new mothers at the post-partum period to help with discharge. They are held in place between the woman's vulva and her undergarment either by being adhered onto the user's undergarment or wrapped around the undergarment's gusset. Rarely, they are held in place by being attached to clips or pins on a menstrual belt worn around the woman's waist. Some menstruation pads are designed to be worn once and disposed after use; others are designed to be reused or reworn by washing and drying them after wearing. Reusable pads are usually made of cotton fabric pockets into which absorbent cotton fleece leak-resistant pads are inserted. The absorbent inserts can be layered to accommodate light, moderate, or heavy menstrual flow. They are held in place by wrapping extended fabric tabs around the undergarment's gusset; these flaps may include snaps to help hold the pad in place. Single use disposable pads are usually made of an underlying non-permeable layer (usually made of plastic) which is held against the undergarment; an absorbent layer (usually made of polyacrylate gel, or wood cellulose fibers, or other absorbent material); and a soft, perforated, plastic surface layer that is held against the wearer's body. Disposable pads are available in several different sizes, such as mini, maxi, long, and to accommodate light, moderate, or heavy menstrual flow."
