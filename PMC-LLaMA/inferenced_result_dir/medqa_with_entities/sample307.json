    "question": "A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Follow the daughter’s wishes to withhold the operation",
      "B": "Refer this case to the court",
      "C": "Contact another family member for consent",
      "D": "Report the daughter to the police"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s daughter is the appropriate surrogate for decision making, even though she is an adult child. The daughter has the right to withhold consent for the operation, even though it is life-saving, because she wants “to live in peace.” The physician should not contact another family member or report the daughter to the police. There is no advanced directive because the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and they are not likely to have had a close relationship. The physician should not perform the operation without consent.\n\n###COMMENT: This case illustrates the problems that can arise when an adult child is the surrogate for a terminally ill or incapacitated parent. The daughter has the right to withhold consent for the operation, even though it is life-saving, because she wants “to live in peace.” The physician should not contact another family member or report the daughter to the police.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
