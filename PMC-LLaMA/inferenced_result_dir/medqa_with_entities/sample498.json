    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with complaints of cyclic vomiting for 3 days. The vomitus is watery and contains undigested food particles. She also complains of feeling tired and having the “sniffles”. She has not felt like eating or drinking since her symptoms started, and she has not taken any medications. Her concern now is that she immediately gets dizzy when she stands up. Vitals signs include: pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 9/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Her eyes are sunken, and her tongue appears dry. Which set of lab values would best correspond to this patient’s condition?",
