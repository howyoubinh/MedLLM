    "question": "A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?",
    "options": {
      "A": "PPV decreases, NPV decreases",
      "B": "PPV decreases, NPV increases",
      "C": "PPV increases, NPV decreases",
      "D": "PPV unchanged, NPV unchanged"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The positive predictive value (PPV) of a screening test is the probability that a patient with a positive test result has, in fact, the disease in question. The negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that a patient with a negative test result does not have the disease in question.\n\nIn this case, the PPV is directly related to the prevalence of the disease in the population. As the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, the PPV of the imaging test will decrease. Conversely, the NPV is inversely related to the prevalence of the disease in the population. As the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the NPV of the imaging test will increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Option A, PPV decreases and NPV decreases.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
