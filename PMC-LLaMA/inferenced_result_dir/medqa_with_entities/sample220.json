    "question": "A 48-year-old man seeks evaluation at a clinic with a complaint of breathlessness for the past couple of weeks. He says that he finds it difficult to walk a few blocks and has to rest. He also complains of a cough for the past 3 months, which is dry and hacking in nature. The medical history is relevant for an idiopathic arrhythmia for which he takes amiodarone daily. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. He denies any use of illicit drugs. The vital signs are as follows: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.6°C (99.68°F), and blood pressure 132/70 mm Hg. The physical examination is significant for inspiratory crackles over the lung bases. An echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction. A chest radiograph is performed and shown below. Which of the following findings will most likely be noted on spirometry?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased FEV1 and normal FVC",
      "B": "Decreased FEV1 and FVC with decreased FEV1/FVC ratio",
      "C": "Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio",
      "D": "Increased FEV1 and FVC"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The chest radiograph shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates predominantly in the lower lobes. This patient has a history of recent-onset breathlessness, cough, and crackles on examination. The chest radiograph is consistent with a pulmonary infiltrate. The patient is taking amiodarone, which can cause pulmonary toxicity. The most likely finding on spirometry will be decreased FEV1 and FVC with a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
