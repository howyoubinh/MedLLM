    "question": "A previously healthy 52-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after sustaining burns over 45% of her body in a house fire. On arrival, she is in acute distress but is fully oriented. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit of a burn center. 20 hours later, she has several large, tarry black stools and develops hypotension and tachycardia. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, she dies. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased prostaglandin synthesis",
      "B": "Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole",
      "C": "Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum",
      "D": "Decreased gastric blood flow"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with gastric mucosal ischemia and hemorrhage, a common complication of severe burns. The hyperdynamic phase of burn shock is characterized by intense vasodilation of the peripheral circulation, which shunts a large portion of the cardiac output away from the splanchnic organs. This decreased blood flow leads to ischemia of the gastric mucosa, which is rich in tortuous submucosal arterioles. The resulting hemorrhage from these dilated vessels appears as tarry black stools. Decreased prostaglandin synthesis by the ischemic gastric mucosa may impair platelet aggregation and contribute to the bleeding. Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum may occur in the presence of gastric antral erosions, which are more common in patients who have undergone nasogastric tube placement. Increased gastric blood flow is not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms, as it would actually potentiate the bleeding.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
