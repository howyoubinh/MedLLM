    "question": "A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after the sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient also manifests symptoms of redness and swelling of the face and lips without pruritus. Her symptoms began following a tooth extraction earlier in the morning. She had a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident 1 year ago, which resolved within 48 hours without treatment. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and an enlarged tongue. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound shows segmental thickening of the intestinal wall. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
