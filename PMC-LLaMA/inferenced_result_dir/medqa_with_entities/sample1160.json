    "question": "A 31-year-old female patient presents with significant swelling and redness of her fingers that is causing her significant pain. Her right knee has also been stiff and slightly swollen for the past 6 weeks. She is overall fatigued and has difficulty moving around but has not sought medical attention until now. On physical examination, the distal interphalangeal joints are swollen, warm, and painful; her nails are pitted and cracked. There are also rough, erythematous skin patches seen over her elbows which have been present for the last few months. She reports that herer father has a similar condition. They both use hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids with moderate benefit. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Gout",
      "B": "Reactive arthritis",
      "C": "Psoriatic arthritis",
      "D": "Dermatomyositis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is C. Psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a seronegative inflammatory arthritis that can be associated with psoriasis. The classic presentation of psoriatic arthritis includes dactylitis (sausage digit), nail involvement (pitting, ridging, and yellow discoloration), and inflammation of the DIP joints. The skin findings in psoriasis can include scaling erythematous plaques and may also involve the scalp, elbows, and knees. The nails can also be involved with pitting, ridging, and yellow discoloration. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes gout, reactive arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. Gout would be unlikely in this patient because it rarely involves the small joints of the hands. The history does not suggest a recent infection that would be consistent with reactive arthritis. The skin findings are not consistent with dermatomyositis. The nail findings are not consistent with onychomycosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
