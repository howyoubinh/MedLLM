    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to establish care with a family physician after having progressively worsening back pain. He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Testing for serum Ca and PTH",
      "B": "Calcium and Vitamin D prescription",
      "C": "Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies",
      "D": "Testing for serum ferritin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical scenario suggests a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. The next best step in management would be to test for serum ESR and autoantibodies. The clinical presentation of joint pain and stiffness, along with dactylitis (sausage digit), is suggestive of psoriatic arthritis. The presence of inflammatory joint disease in the hands is also consistent with this diagnosis. Psoriatic arthritis is associated with HLA-CW6, so this should be tested as well. Psoriatic arthritis is also associated with uveitis, which can cause visual changes. Therefore, an ophthalmology examination should also be considered.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
