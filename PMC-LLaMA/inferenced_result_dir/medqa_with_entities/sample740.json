    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes insulin. He complains of frequent episodes of waking up in the middle of his sleep. When he wakes up, he feels excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. His morning blood glucose is high on repeated measurement. Which of the following is the optimal intervention for this patient condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Reassurance",
      "B": "Adding pramlintide",
      "C": "Increasing daily insulin dose",
      "D": "Reducing daily insulin dose"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is experiencing episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia, which is causing him to awaken during the night. The symptoms of sweating, tremor, and weakness are all manifestations of sympathetic nervous system activation due to hypoglycemia. The morning blood glucose is high because the nocturnal hypoglycemia has caused the pancreas to release more insulin, resulting in lower blood glucose levels. The best treatment for this patient is to reduce the dose of insulin at night. This will prevent the nocturnal hypoglycemia and eliminate the sympathetic nervous system activation during sleep.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
