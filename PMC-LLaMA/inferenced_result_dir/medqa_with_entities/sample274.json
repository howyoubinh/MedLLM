    "question": "A 67-year-old white man presents to his primary care provider for an annual examination. He notes a pink bump that has rapidly developed on his forehead over the last month. In the past, he has had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug (as shown in the image). Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Keratoacanthoma",
      "B": "Basal cell carcinoma",
      "C": "Seborrheic keratosis",
      "D": "Kaposi's sarcoma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The lesion is a keratoacanthoma. These lesions have the distinctive appearance described in the question stem, and occur most commonly on sun-exposed areas. They can mimic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but tend to occur in younger patients and have a more rapid growth rate. They often regress over several months, and may even disappear completely. They are thought to be related to sun exposure, but are not clearly related to the development of SCC. They may be related to chronic sun damage, but are not clearly related to the development of SCC. They may be related to chronic sun damage, but are not clearly related to the development of SCC. They may be related to chronic sun damage, but are not clearly related to the development of SCC.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
