    "question": "Four days after admission to the hospital for pneumonia, a 68-year-old woman develops abdominal pain and watery, foul-smelling diarrhea. Current medications include intravenous ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin. Stool cultures grow gram-positive, anaerobic rods. She is moved to an isolated hospital room. Sterilization with which of the following agents is most likely to prevent transmission of this pathogen to the next patient who will occupy her room?",

Iodine-based solutions are used as disinfectants for medical instruments and are not used as antiseptics for surgical hand scrubs or for disinfecting environmental surfaces within patient care areas. Isopropanol-based solutions are used as disinfectants for medical instruments and are not used as antiseptics for surgical hand scrubs or for disinfecting environmental surfaces within patient care areas. Quaternary ammonium compounds are used as disinfectants for medical instruments and are not used as antiseptics for surgical hand scrubs or for disinfecting environmental surfaces within patient care areas.\n\nDisinfectants for medical instruments and for disinfecting environmental surfaces within patient care areas are not usually used for surgical hand scrubs or as antiseptics for superficial wounds.\n\nDisinfectants for medical instruments and for disinfecting environmental surfaces within patient care areas should be selected on the basis of efficacy against the likely pathogens, the degree of chemical resistance of the instrument or surface, and the speed of action required.\n\nCommonly used disinfectants for medical instruments and for disinfecting environmental surfaces within patient care areas are listed in the table below.\n\nDisinfectant Use\n\nClostridium tetani (tetanus)\n\nTetanus is caused by a gram-positive, spore-forming obligate anaerobe.\n\nThe sp",
