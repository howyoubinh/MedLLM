    "question": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises 3-4 times a week and eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alpha-adrenergic agonist",
      "B": "Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors",
      "C": "Disruption of disulfide bonds",
      "D": "Short acting beta-2 agonist"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The medication in question is likely an antihistamine, which competitively blocks the muscarinic receptors, thereby alleviating symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., pseudoephedrine) are sympathomimetics that cause vasoconstriction. Disruption of disulfide bonds (e.g., with dapsone) is used to treat leprosy. Short-acting beta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) are bronchodilators used to treat asthma.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
