    "question": "A 69-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. Physical examination shows nontender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. The spleen is palpated 5 cm below the costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 and platelet count is 217,000/mm3. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ringed sideroblasts",

  "model_response": "The patient has a reactive (benign) plasmacytosis. Smudge cells are seen when lymphocytes are damaged during the process of making peripheral blood smears. Ringed sideroblasts are seen in sideroblastic anemia. Teardrop cells are seen in myelofibrosis. Hypergammaglobulinemia is seen in multiple myeloma.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
