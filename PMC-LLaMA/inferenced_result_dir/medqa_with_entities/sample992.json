    "question": "A 55-year-old male with a history of stage I colon cancer status-post left hemicolectomy presents to your office for follow-up. You intend to discuss the results from his recent surveillance colonoscopy, which showed no remaining cancer, no polyps, and a well-healed anastmosis. During your meeting, you note that the patient is exhibiting the defense mechanism of suppression. Which of the following statements from the patient is consistent with your impression?",
    "options": {
      "A": "\"Last week I volunteered for the local Cancer Society. Helping other cancer patients just makes me feel better.\"",
      "B": "\"Oh, doctor, I'm just so grateful to be seeing you. I just know you've cured my cancer. I probably don't even need to check anymore.\"",
      "C": "\"I'm sorry I was late today. I also didn't get any of the labs you asked for.\"",
      "D": "\"I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Suppression is the conscious or semiconscious decision to not think about an anxiety-provoking event or situation. In this case, the patient is consciously avoiding thinking about the colonoscopy until he meets with you. His behavior is aimed at reducing anxiety in the short-term, but it may come at the expense of accurate information about his condition.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
