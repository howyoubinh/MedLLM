    "question": "A 74-year-old man undergoes an open cholecystectomy. Surgery is performed under general anesthesia for which the patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube. Directly following the procedure, his temperature is 37째C (98.6째F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. He is extubated as soon as he showed signs of alertness. Five minutes later, he becomes unresponsive. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He underwent stenting of the right coronary artery 10 years ago. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 2 weeks ago for surgery. He drinks one to two beers daily. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, aspirin, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin. His temperature is 37째C (98.6째F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 73%. He is put on a non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%. Three minutes later, he is still unresponsive. His arterial blood gas analysis shows:\npH 7.32\nPCO2 33 mm Hg\nPO2 73 mm Hg\nHCO3 22 mEq/L\nO2 saturation 73%\nWhich of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?\"",

      "B": "Continue using the non-rebreather mask",
      "C": "Reintubate",

His arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.32 (acidemia), PCO2 33 mm Hg (hypocarbia), PO2 73 mm Hg (hypoxemia), HCO3 22 mEq/L (normal), and O2 saturation 73% (hypoxemia). The patient is showing signs of type II respiratory failure. The next step in the management of this patient is to reintubate and start mechanical ventilation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
