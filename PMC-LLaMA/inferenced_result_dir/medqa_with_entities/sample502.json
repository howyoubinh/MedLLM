She denies any other symptoms and states that she has not gained any weight. On exam, you notice a 2 cm nodule on her anterior neck. Her TSH level is normal and radionucleotide scan reveals a cold nodule. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) reveals follicular architecture suspicious for malignancy. What is the next best step?",
