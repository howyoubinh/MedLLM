    "question": "A 34-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was the restrained driver. On arrival, she has a cervical collar in place and is unresponsive. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 131/76 mm Hg. Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. She is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury at the level of C3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Electroencephalography",
      "B": "Magnetic resonance angiography",
      "C": "Deep tendon reflex testing",
      "D": "Corneal reflex test"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The next step in diagnosing brain death is electroencephalography (EEG). An EEG can confirm the presence of electrocerebral silence, which is consistent with brain death. Electrocerebral silence is defined as the absence of clinical brain activity and is manifested on EEG by the absence of electrical brain activity. An isoelectric EEG is indicative of brain death, but it is not necessary to perform an isoelectric EEG to declare brain death. A CT scan showing a massive intracranial bleed is consistent with brain death, but it is not necessary to perform a CT scan to declare brain death. An apnea test can be performed to diagnose brain death, but it is not the next step. Deep tendon reflex testing is not used to diagnose brain death. Corneal reflex testing is not used to diagnose brain death.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
