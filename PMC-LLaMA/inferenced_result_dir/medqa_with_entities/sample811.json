    "question": "A 39-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of personality changes over the past year. He has become increasingly irritable, loud, aggressive, and impulsive. His wife also reports jerky movements of his limbs and trunk for the past few months. His father had dementia in his mid-40s, but the details of his condition are unclear. The patient appears restless. Examination shows irregular movements of the extremities and twitching of the face and tongue. Mental status examination shows impaired memory. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following changes on MRI?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Reduced hippocampal volume",
      "B": "Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions",
      "C": "Degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes",
      "D": "Atrophy of the striatum"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of personality changes along with involuntary movements (i.e., dyskinesias) suggests a possibility of Huntington disease (HD). HD is a genetic disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance. The mutation is a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene, which codes for the protein huntingtin. The disease usually manifests in the fourth decade of life but can present at any age. MRI reveals atrophy of the caudate nucleus and, to a lesser extent, the putamen. The putamen and globus pallidus are also atrophic in Parkinson disease, but the caudate nucleus is spared. In addition, Parkinson disease presents with a characteristic tremor and is usually not associated with personality changes. Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions (choice B) could be seen in a patient with hypertension or diabetes.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
