    "question": "A 44-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. She has no history of serious illness and does not take any medication. She has been working in a law firm for the past 20 years and travels to the Carribean regularly with her husband. Examination of her skin shows no abnormal moles or warts. This woman is at greatest risk of which of the following types of melanoma?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Desmoplastic",
      "B": "Nodular",
      "C": "Acral lentiginous",
      "D": "Superficial spreading"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Desmoplastic melanoma is the most common type of melanoma in elderly individuals, but it is rare in young patients. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type of melanoma in young patients, especially if they have a history of significant sun exposure. Nodular melanoma is the most malignant form of melanoma and is more common in older patients. Acral lentiginous melanoma is the least common type of melanoma and is most common on the palms, soles, and nail beds.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
