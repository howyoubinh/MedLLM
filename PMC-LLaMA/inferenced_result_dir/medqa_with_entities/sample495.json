    "question": "A 55-year-old woman is found to have an abnormal mass on routine mammography. The mass is biopsied and cytology results are diagnostic for invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. The patient is started on chemotherapy and ultimately has the mass resected. She is taking tamoxifen and has regular outpatient follow up appointments to monitor for any recurrence of cancer. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, obesity, and a uterine leimyoma which was definitively treated last year. Her last menstrual period was at the age of 47. The patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable. Which of the following is a potential complication that could occur in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Deep venous thrombosis",
      "B": "Eruption of seborrheic keratoses",
      "C": "Increased bleeding",
      "D": "Osteoporosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient is at increased risk for deep venous thrombosis due to her use of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is an estrogen antagonist that is used in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. It is associated with a two fold increased risk of deep venous thrombosis. The eruption of seborrheic keratoses is a benign condition that is not associated with breast cancer or its treatment. Increased bleeding is not associated with breast cancer or its treatment. Osteoporosis is not associated with breast cancer or its treatment.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
