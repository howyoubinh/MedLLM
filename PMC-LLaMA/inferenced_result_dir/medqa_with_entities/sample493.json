    "question": "A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath after prolonged exposure to cold air during a recent hike with his friends. He informs the physician that he is asthmatic, but does not use inhalers regularly because he does not like using medications. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system",
      "B": "Arachidonic acid system",
      "C": "Phosphoinositol system",
      "D": "Tyrosine kinase system"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug that blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. The muscarinic receptors in the lung are mainly of the M3 subtype, which are responsible for bronchoconstriction. Ipratropium bromide is an inhalational anticholinergic bronchodilator that acts by inhibiting the effects of acetylcholine at the M3 receptors on bronchial smooth muscle. This results in bronchodilation and relieves the symptoms of asthma. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system is activated by nitric oxide (NO). NO activates guanylyl cyclase, which leads to an increase in cGMP. cGMP is an important second messenger in many cell types. It activates protein kinase G (PKG), which can phosphorylate proteins, leading to their activation or inactivation. The arachidonic acid system is important in the inflammatory response. Arachidonic acid is a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid that is derived from dietary sources or is synthesized from the essential fatty acid linoleic acid. Arachidonic acid is converted into prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes by the action of various enzymes, including cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and -2) and lipoxygenases. The phosphoinositol system is important in the regulation of many cellular processes, including smooth muscle contraction, cell growth, and the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This system is activated by a group of hormones that bind to specific receptors on the cell membrane. The hormone-receptor complex activates an enzyme called phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce diacylglycerol and the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). IP3 releases calcium from internal stores, which can activate protein kinases and other enzymes. Tyrosine kinase receptors are a class of cell surface receptors that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. These receptors contain an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain in their intracellular region. Upon binding of a ligand, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), the tyrosine kinase receptor is activated, and autophosphorylates tyrosine residues on its cytoplasmic domain. Autophosphorylation of the receptor activates other tyrosine kinases, including Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). JAK2 phosphorylates a number of substrates, leading to cellular responses.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
