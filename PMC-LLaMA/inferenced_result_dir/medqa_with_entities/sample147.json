    "question": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been feeling very stressed over the past several months. During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
