    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a change in his behavior over the past few months. Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alzheimer dementia",
      "B": "Frontotemporal dementia",
      "C": "Kluver-Bucy syndrome",
      "D": "Vascular dementia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is Kluver-Bucy syndrome. This is a syndrome that is characterized by inappropriate behavior, hypersexuality, hyper-oral tendencies, and memory loss. It is caused by bilateral lesions of the medial temporal lobes and is usually associated with traumatic brain injury. The other choices do not have the characteristic clinical features seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
