    "question": "A 55-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than 5 pads per day. Menopause occurred 1 year ago. She attained menarche at 10 years of age. She has a history of hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Current medications include levothyroxine and metformin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix. The uterus and adnexa are nontender to palpation. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows an endometrial thickness of 6 mm. Endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Total hysterectomy",
      "B": "Estrogen vaginal cream",
      "C": "Reassurance and follow-up",
      "D": "Progestin therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a presentation consistent with endometrial hyperplasia. The most common cause of endometrial hyperplasia is estrogen exposure. In this postmenopausal woman, the most likely source of estrogen is a combination of peripheral conversion of androgen to estrone and possible production of estrogen by ovarian folliculogenesis. The latter is unlikely to be of significance in this patient with a history of menopause and a negative pelvic examination. The endometrial thickness is not excessive, and cytology is benign. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and follow-up. She should be advised to limit hormone replacement to the lowest effective dose and to use progestin for the last 2 weeks in each cycle.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
