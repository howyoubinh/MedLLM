    "question": "A 48-year-old female presents for a follow-up appointment to discuss her ultrasound results. She presented with a lump in her neck 2 weeks ago. On examination, a thyroid nodule was present; the nodule was fixed, immobile, and non-tender. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. Histological examination of a fine needle biopsy was performed and cytological examination reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia. CT scan is performed to check for any lesions in the bones and/or lungs, common metastatic sites in this condition. Treatment with radioiodine therapy is planned after near-total thyroidectomy. Considering this tumor, which of the following is the most likely initial metastatic site in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Trachea",
      "B": "Cervical lymph nodes",
      "C": "Inferior thyroid arteries",
      "D": "Thyrohyoid muscle"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The answer is A: Trachea. The most common site of initial metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid cancer is the trachea. This is followed by spread to the lungs, bones, liver, and brain. The trachea is involved in 3-8% of cases, and the lungs in 2-4%. Lymph node involvement is seen in 30-50% of cases.
