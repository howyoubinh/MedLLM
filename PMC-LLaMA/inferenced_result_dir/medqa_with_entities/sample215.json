    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes for the past 2 months. He does not complain of any pain during urination. He is frustrated that he has to wake up 2 or 3 times per night to urinate even though he tried reducing the amount of water he consumes before bed and made some other dietary changes without any improvement. He has no family history of prostate disease. Physical examination is negative for any suprapubic mass or tenderness, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Urinalysis and serum creatinine",
      "B": "Reassurance",
      "C": "Digital rectal examination",
      "D": "Prostate-specific antigen"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's symptoms are suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The next best step in the management of this patient is to perform a digital rectal examination (DRE) to check for prostate nodules, masses, or tenderness. The physical examination should also include assessment of the kidneys, bladder, and penis. Urinalysis and serum creatinine are indicated if there is evidence of urinary tract infection or impaired renal function. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is not indicated in this patient because he has no family history of prostate cancer and his physical examination is negative for any prostate abnormalities. Prostate-specific antigen is indicated in men aged 50 to 69 years with at least a 10-year life expectancy for screening of prostate cancer.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
