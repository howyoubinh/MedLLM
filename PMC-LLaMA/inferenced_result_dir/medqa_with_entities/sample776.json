    "question": "A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?",
    "options": {
      "A": "25/250",
      "B": "250/25",
      "C": "190/250",
      "D": "355/500"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The number needed to treat (NNT) for the new drug is calculated by dividing the number of people who were cured by the new drug (190) by the number of people who were cured by the standard therapy (250), giving us a ratio of 190/250. The NNT is then calculated by taking the reciprocal of this ratio, which is 190/250*1/190 = 250/190. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
