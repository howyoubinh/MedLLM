    "question": "A 26-year-old man presents to the office complaining of persistent epigastric pain for the past 2 months. He states that his pain is worse a few hours after he eats. His father had similar symptoms. Past medical history is insignificant. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. The vital signs include blood pressure 120/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination is insignificant except for mild epigastric tenderness. A metabolic panel reveals the following:\nSerum sodium 136 mEq/L\nSerum potassium 4.2 mEq/L\nCalcium 13.2 mg/dL\nBicarbonate 26 mEq/L\nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals multiple duodenal ulcers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease",
      "B": "Gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal type",
      "C": "VIPoma",
      "D": "MEN1"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a typical presentation of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). ZES is a non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas that secretes gastrin. The gastrin increases the acid production in the stomach, leading to the formation of multiple duodenal ulcers. The patient with ZES typically presents with epigastric pain that is worse with eating. The pain is due to the increased acid production and results in a cycle of pain, increased eating, and increased acid production. The increased acid production can also result in esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux. The increased acid production is rarely due to a non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas. More commonly, the increased acid production is due to a gastrin-producing tumor of the pancreas. The gastrinoma is most commonly found in the head of the pancreas. The increased gastrin production is not due to a beta cell tumor of the pancreas. The beta cell tumor of the pancreas is most commonly associated with diabetes mellitus and hyperinsulinemia. The increased gastrin production is not due to a non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas. The non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas is most commonly associated with pheochromocytoma and hypercalcemia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
