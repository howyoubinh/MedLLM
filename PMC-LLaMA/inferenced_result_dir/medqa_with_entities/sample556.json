    "question": "A previously healthy 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of generalized malaise and a palpable swelling in the left axilla. The parents report that 2 weeks ago, his daycare group visited an animal shelter, after which he developed a rash on the left hand. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows three linear crusts on an erythematous background on the dorsum of the left hand. There is tender left-sided axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic examination of an axillary lymph node shows necrotizing granulomas. The most likely causal organism of this patient's clinical findings is also involved in the pathogenesis of which of the following conditions?",
