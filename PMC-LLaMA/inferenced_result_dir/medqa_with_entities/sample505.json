    "question": "A 42-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with decreased consciousness and convulsions. His wife reports that 30 min following the onset of her husband’s condition, which started approximately 6 hours ago, he treated his garden bed with pesticides against mice. He developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The patient noted facial muscle twitching and developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 3 minutes, 4 hours following the onset of his condition. His past medical history is insignificant for any seizure disorders, and he does not take any medications. His blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 104/min, respiratory rate is 10/min, and the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient’s consciousness is decreased with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. He is pale and sweaty. His lung sounds are normal, cardiac sounds are decreased, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals epigastric tenderness. Neurological examination shows rapid downbeating nystagmus, facial muscle twitching, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities. Further discussion reveals that the patient was using sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide, which is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient’s cells?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Fumarate",
      "B": "Citrate",
      "C": "Malate",
      "D": "Succinate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is suffering from fluoroacetate poisoning. Fluoroacetate is converted to fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Fluorocitrate is a potent inhibitor of aconitase, which is a key enzyme in the citric acid cycle. This results in citrate accumulation. Citrate is an allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step of glycolysis. This results in increased levels of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate, which inhibits the activity of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). This results in decreased levels of fructose-6-phosphate, which is the substrate for 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate kinase, which catalyzes the production of 3-phosphoglycerate. This results in decreased levels of 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate, which is an allosteric activator of the enzyme pyruvate kinase. This results in decreased levels of pyruvate, which is the substrate for lactate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. This results in increased levels of lactate, which accumulates in the blood. This leads to lactic acidosis, which is the cause of the patient's decreased consciousness and convulsions.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Jerk nystagmus has a slow phase in one direction followed by a corrective fast phase in the opposite direction, and is usually caused by central or peripheral vestibular dysfunction. Pendular nystagmus features oscillations that are of equal velocity in both directions and this condition is often associated with visual loss early in life.
