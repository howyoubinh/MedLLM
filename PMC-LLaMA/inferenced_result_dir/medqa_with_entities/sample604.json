    "question": "A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of fever and a rash for 6 days. His temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Examination shows right-sided anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral conjunctival injection, erythema of the tongue and lips, and a maculopapular rash involving the hands, feet, perineum, and trunk. Which of the following is the most common complication of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Coronary artery aneurysm",
      "B": "Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis",
      "C": "Hearing loss",
      "D": "Retinopathy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has measles, which is caused by a Morbillivirus. The most common complication of measles is otitis media, which occurs in up to 50% of cases. Other complications include mastoiditis, pneumonia, bronchitis, and laryngitis. Encephalitis occurs in 1 in 1,000 cases, and the mortality rate is 1 in 500. Coronary artery aneurysms occur in up to 25% of cases and are the most common cause of death. They usually occur 1 to 2 weeks after onset of the illness and are associated with a 20% mortality rate. Other manifestations include myocarditis, pericarditis, and myositis. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare complication that occurs 5 to 15 years after the initial infection; it is characterized by progressive mental deterioration, involuntary movements, muscular rigidity, and coma. SSPE is usually seen in patients who were infected at a very young age.\n\nGlucocorticoids are indicated for patients with laryngotracheitis and bronchiolitis. They have not been shown to be effective for other manifestations of measles. Isolation precautions are indicated for at least 4 days after the onset of the rash. Live measles vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy.\n\nRubella, rubeola, and erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) cause morbilliform eruptions. In rubella and rubeola, the rash begins on the face and then spreads to the trunk and extremities. In fifth disease, the rash begins on the trunk and then spreads to the face and extremities. In all three diseases, the rash is maculopapular, but it is usually more erythematous (slapped cheek appearance) in fifth disease. Fifth disease is caused by human parvovirus B19.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
