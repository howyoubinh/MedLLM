    "question": "A 58-year-old male is hospitalized after sustaining multiple fractures in a severe automobile accident. Soon after hospitalization, he develops respiratory distress with crackles present bilaterally on physical examination. The patient does not respond to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen and quickly dies due to respiratory insufficiency. Autopsy reveals heavy, red lungs and histology is shown in Image A. Which of the following is most likely to have been present in this patient shortly before death:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Diaphragmatic hypertrophy",
      "B": "Interstitial edema",
      "C": "Large pulmonary embolus",
      "D": "Left apical bronchoalveolar carcinoma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient had Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The image shows diffuse alveolar damage with formation of hyaline membranes from extravasated plasma proteins. The alveolar walls become lined with type I pneumocytes and interstitial edema is prominent. The other choices are not characteristic of ARDS.\n\n###COMMENT: The patient most likely sustained a traumatic insult (crush injury) which led to the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that resulted in the development of ARDS.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
