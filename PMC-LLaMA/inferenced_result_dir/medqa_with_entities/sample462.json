    "question": "A 5-year-old male presents to the pediatrician with a 10-day history of cough that is worse at night. The patient has a history of mild intermittent asthma and has been using his albuterol inhaler without relief. He has also been complaining of headache and sore throat, and his mother has noticed worsening rhinorrhea. The patient’s past medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he has no known drug allergies. In the office, his temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 88/65 mmHg, pulse is 132/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient has purulent mucus draining from the nares, and his face is tender to palpation over the maxillary sinuses. His pharynx is erythematous with symmetric swelling of the tonsils. On lung exam, he has moderate bilateral expiratory wheezing.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amoxicillin",
      "B": "Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid",
      "C": "Clindamycin",
      "D": "Levofloxacin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation suggests the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis with a secondary complication of pneumonia. The presence of purulent mucus, facial tenderness, and sinus pain are typical of acute sinusitis. The patient’s fever, respiratory rate, and pulse are consistent with a moderate degree of airway obstruction. The patient’s history of mild intermittent asthma may contribute to his respiratory symptoms, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of his acute illness. The patient should be treated with an appropriate antibiotic to cover the most likely pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amoxicillin is effective against these pathogens, but the increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis may require the use of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Clindamycin is active against most strains of MRSA and would be a good choice if the patient had risk factors for MRSA (eg, recent hospitalization, recent antibiotic therapy, living in a community with a high incidence of MRSA). However, clindamycin does not provide adequate coverage for the likely pathogens in this patient. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is often used for sinusitis and pneumonia. However, it is not recommended as first-line therapy for sinusitis in children because of the potential for cartilage damage.\n\nThe patient should also receive a bucolic to help break up the mucus, a cough suppressant to help control the cough, and an antihistamine to help relieve his symptoms of rhinitis. In addition, the patient should be placed on a short course of systemic steroids to help decrease the inflammation in his sinuses and lungs.\n\nThe patient’s respiratory distress and fever suggest that he may require hospitalization for his illness. However, if he responds quickly to therapy, he may be able to be treated as an outpatient.\n\n### Suggested answers: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
