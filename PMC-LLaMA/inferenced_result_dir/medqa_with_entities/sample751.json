    "question": "A 1-day-old infant is in the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia. The mother is a healthy 32-year-old woman who did not have regular prenatal exams. On physical examination, you notice low-set ears and retrognathia with abnormal extremity development. Which of the following abnormalities is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hepatosplenomegaly",
      "B": "Posterior urethral valves",
      "C": "Rocker bottom feet",
      "D": "Duodenal atresia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient most likely has thanatophoric dysplasia, which is characterized by micromelia (abnormal limb development), craniofacial abnormalities, and pulmonary hypoplasia. This condition is associated with the use of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which is characterized by growth deficiencies, central nervous system abnormalities, and characteristic facies. Hepatosplenomegaly is associated with congenital infections such as toxoplasmosis and rubella. Posterior urethral valves cause urinary tract obstruction and can be associated with hydronephrosis and renal failure. Rocker bottom feet is a foot deformity associated with diastrophic dwarfism, which is characterized by short limbs and a normal head. Duodenal atresia is associated with polyhydramnios and is characterized by abdominal distention and bilious vomiting.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
