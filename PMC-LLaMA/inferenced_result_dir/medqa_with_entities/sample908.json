    "question": "A 24-year-old primigravida presents to her physician at 20 weeks gestation. She was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria at her last appointment 2 weeks ago, and was treated with amoxicillin. She has no concurrent diseases and no complaints. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 82/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.6℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals no abnormalities. On gynecologic examination, the cervix is soft and non-tender with no discharge from the external os. The uterus is enlarged to the umbilicus and the fetal heart rate is normal. Which of the following statements is the most accurate with respect to the presented case?",
    "options": {
      "A": "This patient does not require further urinary tests unless she becomes symptomatic.",
      "B": "Urinalysis should be performed on each subsequent antenatal visit to screen for possible recurrence of bacteriuria.",
      "C": "Urine culture should be performed in this patient again.",
      "D": "Urinalysis should be performed to check for leukocytes, blood, and bacteria; if positive, perform a urine culture."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient should have a urine culture performed again because of the high risk of developing pyelonephritis (15-20%) if untreated. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is more common in primigravida women than in multigravida women. It is more common in women with anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, but this patient has no such abnormalities.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
