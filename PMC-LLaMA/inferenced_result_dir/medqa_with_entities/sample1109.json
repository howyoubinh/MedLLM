    "question": "A 46-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-week history of fatigue and headache that have gotten progressively worse. He has allergic asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. He immigrated to the USA from Thailand 9 years ago. He lives by himself and works as a waiter in a restaurant. He has had 6 lifetime male sexual partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He drinks 1–2 beers daily. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Examination of the mouth shows several white patches on the tongue and oral mucosa that can be easily scraped off with a tongue blade. On mental status examination, the patient is somnolent and has short-term memory deficits. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.6 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 9,600/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 80%\nEosinophils 1%\nLymphocytes 17%\nMonocytes 2%\nCD4+ T-lymphocytes 80/mm3 (Normal ≥ 500)\nPlatelet count 328,000/mm3\nSerum\npH 7.36\nNa+ 135 mEq/L\nCl- 101 mEq/L\nK+ 4.8 mEq/L\nHCO3- 22 mEq/L\nGlucose 95 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nBUN 16 mg/dL\nBilirubin, total 0.7 mg/dL\nAST 13 U/L\nALT 15 U/L\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 10 mm/hour\nHIV test positive\nA lumbar puncture is performed and an opening pressure of 150 mm H2O is noted. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 25/mm3 (60% lymphocytes), protein concentration of 52 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 37 mg/dL. India ink stain shows organisms with prominent capsules. Blood cultures are drawn. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's neurological symptoms?\"",
