    "question": "A 75-year-old with hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the emergency department because of a 2-hour history of severe abdominal pain and nausea. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. The patient undergoes emergency laparotomy and is found to have dusky discoloration of the hepatic colonic flexure and an adjacent segment of the transverse colon. The most likely cause of his condition is occlusion of a branch of which of the following arteries?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Median sacral artery",
      "B": "Inferior mesenteric artery",
      "C": "Celiac artery",
      "D": "Superior mesenteric artery"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has ischemic colitis, which is usually the result of occlusion of a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. The splenic flexure of the colon is particularly vulnerable to ischemic injury because of the narrow caliber of the inferior mesenteric artery at this point and the tenuous blood supply. The median sacral artery is a small branch of the abdominal aorta that supplies the sacral region. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the left one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. The celiac artery is the artery of origin of the abdominal branches of the aorta. The superior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta and supplies the midgut from the distal half of the duodenum through two-thirds of the transverse colon.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
