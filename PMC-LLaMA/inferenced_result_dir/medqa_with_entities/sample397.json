    "question": "An otherwise healthy 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg and the pulse is 100/min. Past medical history is noncontributory and he takes no medication. His father and aunt both suffer from mild anemia. On examination, he is very pale and his spleen is enlarged. His hemoglobin is 5 g/dL and platelet count is slightly reduced. His peripheral blood smear is shown in the picture. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient recovers, and his hemoglobin is 11 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the pattern of inheritance of this patient underlying disorder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Autosomal dominant",
      "B": "X-linked recessive",
      "C": "X-linked dominant",
      "D": "Multifactorial"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The peripheral blood smear shows numerous target cells and a few nucleated red blood cells. The patient has the characteristic presentation of a hemolytic anemia due to a membrane abnormality. The most likely diagnosis is hereditary spherocytosis. The pattern of inheritance of hereditary spherocytosis is autosomal dominant.\n\nHereditary spherocytosis is caused by diverse mutations that lead to an insufficiency of membrane skeletal components. The loss of membrane skeletal components leads to loss of membrane stability, and consequently spherical rather than biconcave shape of red cells. The loss of membrane causes the red cells to be less deformable, and thus more prone to splenic sequestration and destruction. The loss of membrane also causes the red cells to be less able to exchange ions with the surrounding plasma, and thus more prone to oxidative injury. The most common mutations involve the gene coding for ankyrin, but mutations involving other genes coding for membrane skeletal proteins are also common.\n\nThe diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis is usually readily established by a positive family history, splenomegaly, and the characteristic peripheral blood smear. The diagnosis is confirmed by osmotic fragility testing and flow cytometry. The treatment of hereditary spherocytosis is splenectomy, which is usually followed by a dramatic improvement in hemolysis and anemia.\n\nHereditary spherocytosis is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance.
