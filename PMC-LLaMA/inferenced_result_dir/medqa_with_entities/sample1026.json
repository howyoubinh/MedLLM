    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?",
