    "question": "A 54-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue. He reports that he recently went on a vacation to South America with his family but just wanted to stay in his hotel all day due to fatigue. His past medical history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. He takes lovastatin and lisinopril. He drinks socially and has a 20 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. On exam, the patient is appropriately interactive and in no acute distress. Mild splenomegaly is noted. Laboratory analysis reveals the following:\n\nHemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL\nHematocrit: 36%\nLeukocyte count: 3,800/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 140,000/mm^3\n\nA bone marrow aspiration is ordered but after multiple attempts, they are unable to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample. A peripheral blood smear would likely reveal cells that stain with which of the following stains?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Prussian Blue",
      "B": "Ziehl-Neelsen",
      "C": "Periodic acid-Schiff",
      "D": "Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The peripheral blood smear would likely reveal cells that stain with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. The patient likely has hairy cell leukemia. Hairy cell leukemia is a rare B-cell neoplasm that typically presents in middle-aged or older individuals. Patients often have fatigue and splenomegaly. The peripheral blood smear is usually marked by the presence of hairy cells, which have a \"fried egg\" appearance and are larger than mature lymphocytes. These cells stain positive with PAS stain. Bone marrow biopsy classically reveals a pattern of fibrosis. Prussian blue stain would be used to evaluate for iron stores. Ziehl-Neelsen stain is used to evaluate for acid-fast organisms such as Mycobacterium. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is an enzyme found in hairy cells and is used to identify these cells on flow cytometry. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is not used as a stain.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
