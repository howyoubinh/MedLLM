    "question": "A 75-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son because of a 2-day history of fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough. The patient lives with her son and his family and her son reports that other members of the family have had similar symptoms during the past week but that he has not had any symptoms. The result of a polymerase chain reaction test confirms that the woman is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin",
      "B": "Downregulation of ICAM-1 expression",
      "C": "Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions",
      "D": "Homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The son is free of symptoms because he is immune as a result of prior exposure(s) to the virus. The initial infection with influenza results in serum antibodies to the hemagglutinin. Subsequent infections with different strains of influenza result in an increase in antibody levels. The increase in antibody levels results in downregulation of ICAM-1 expression, which interferes with viral entry into cells. Antibodies to neuraminidase prevent the release of progeny virions from infected cells. Progeny virions contain neuraminidase, which destroys the receptors that allow virions to attach to cells. Homozygous mutations in the CCR5 gene result in a deficiency of CCR5, which is a coreceptor for HIV. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation are less likely to become infected with HIV. Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions are not protective against rhinoviruses.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
