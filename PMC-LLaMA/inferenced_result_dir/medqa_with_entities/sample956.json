    "question": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician for intermittent stabbing face pain. The pain typically occurs in waves of several individual episodes lasting about one second. It is bilateral, but rarely occurs on both sides simultaneously. Touching her face or brushing her teeth can trigger an attack. Four months ago, she had an episode of weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week. Family history is notable for migrainous headaches in her mother and brother. Vital signs are within normal limits. There is decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity. There is spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques",
      "B": "Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution",
      "C": "Photophobia and phonophobia",
      "D": "Rhinorrhea, lacrimination, and ptosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of bilateral decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distributions of the face suggests involvement of the trigeminal nerve. The distribution of the trigeminal nerve is shown in the figure below. The first and second divisions of the trigeminal nerve are most commonly involved in cases of trigeminal neuralgia. The presence of spasticity and clonus of the lower extremities suggests a demyelinating process. Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause of demyelinating disease in young adults. The plaques are typically periventricular in location and can be visualized on MRI. The other findings listed are not typically associated with multiple sclerosis.\n\n[Trigeminal nerve distribution.
