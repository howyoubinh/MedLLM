    "question": "A type of fatal adrenal cancer has an average survival rate of 3 years after the onset of clinically significant symptoms. It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms. A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Using survival rates in the analysis",
      "B": "Using mortality rates in the analysis",
      "C": "Increasing the number of screened individuals",
      "D": "Decreasing the number of screened individuals"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The analysis should use survival rates, not mortality rates. The study is longitudinal, and the time at which the study begins is the point at which the screening test becomes available. The study then continues until the final outcome (survival) is known for both groups. The study design is a coho study. The study is biased because the screened group has a longer asymptomatic period (4 years) than the unscreened group (2 years). The study concludes that screening improves outcomes. However, the study design does not allow for a true conclusion, because the groups are not comparable. The screened group has a longer asymptomatic period, which biases the results. The study should continue until both groups have been symptomatic for the same amount of time.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
