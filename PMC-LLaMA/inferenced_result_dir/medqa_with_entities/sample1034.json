    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents to the plastic surgery office 3 months following a rhinoplasty procedure. The patient has been recovering well. However, she has noticed a small whistling noise when she respires through her nose, which you appreciate on physical exam. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this phenomenon?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Post-operative swelling",
      "B": "A septal hematoma causing a perforation",
      "C": "A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow",
      "D": "Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a whistling sound or, as it is more commonly known, \"turbulent\" nasal airflow. This is a common complication of rhinoplasty. The etiology is the alteration of the normal nasal airflow caused by the procedure. The patient may also complain of nasal obstruction or a \"blocked\" feeling. This is usually transient and resolves over a few weeks. The other choices are unrelated to the procedure and are unlikely causes of the patient's symptoms.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
