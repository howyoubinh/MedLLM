    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?",
    "options": {
      "A": "IL-2",
      "B": "IL-10",
      "C": "IL-13",
      "D": "IL-4"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is option C, IL-13. The Th2 subset of helper T cells is involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation and asthma. These cells secrete IL-4, which is the major cytokine responsible for class switching to IgE. IgE is the antibody isotype associated with allergic reactions. IL-13 also has a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. It is produced by Th2 cells and also by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). IL-13 promotes the alternative activation of macrophages, leading to the production of alternative activation products, such as IL-12, and also induces the production of TSLP (Tumor Necrosis Factor-Like Ligand) by epithelial cells. TSLP promotes the activation of dendritic cells and the development of Th2 responses. Inhibition of IL-13 may be a target for the development of new asthma therapies.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
