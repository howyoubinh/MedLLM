The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes and fetal weight is estimated to be at the 90th percentile for gestational age. During delivery, there is an arrest in the second stage of labor, and a vacuum-assisted delivery is performed. Postpartum examination shows a third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position.
