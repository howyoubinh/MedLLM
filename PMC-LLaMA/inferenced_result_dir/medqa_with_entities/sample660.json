    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with a 7 month history of insomnia. The patient admitted to having trouble sleeping from a young age but became more aware of how much this is affecting his health after attending a sleep conference earlier this year. He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\n ",
    "options": {
      "A": "Generalized anxiety disorder",
      "B": "Adjustment disorder",
      "C": "Social anxiety ",
      "D": "Normal worry"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient appears to be suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The diagnostic criteria for GAD include a minimum of 6 months of worry and anxiety about a variety of different events or activities. The anxiety must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The anxiety cannot be attributable to a substance or another medical condition and cannot be better accounted for by another mental disorder. The symptoms of GAD include poor concentration, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. The patient does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of adjustment disorder as his symptoms are more chronic in nature. The patient does not exhibit the social anxiety or avoidance of situations that would be necessary for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. The patient does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as the symptoms of OCD are more persistent and intrusive than those described by the patient. The patient does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of panic disorder as he does not describe recurrent panic attacks.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
