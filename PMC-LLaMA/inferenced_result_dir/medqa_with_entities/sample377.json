    "question": "A 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband for lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. This morning she became drowsy. She returned from a business trip to Sudan 3 weeks ago. She denies eating any seafood while traveling. Medications include iron supplements and a multivitamin. Her immunizations are up-to-date and she has never received blood products. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. She is oriented to person and place. Examination shows jaundice and mild asterixis. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 22-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11.2 g/dL\nProthrombin time 18 sec (INR=2.0)\nSerum\nTotal bilirubin 4.4 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 398 U/L\nAST 4,702 U/L\nALT 3,551 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase 3,412 U/L\nAnti-nuclear antibody negative\nAnti-smooth muscle antibody negative\nAnti-CMV antibody negative\nAnti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody negative\nAn ELISA for HIV is negative. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\"",

  "model_response": "This patient has a severe hepatitis, most likely viral in origin. The high levels of transaminases and bilirubin are consistent with this. The history of travel outside the United States is a clue that should be pursued. All of the viruses listed as answers can cause severe hepatitis, but only hepatitis E is associated with a high fatality rate. The other clues pointing toward hepatitis E include the lack of a history of blood product or seafood ingestion, and the lack of evidence of chronic liver disease. The ELISA for anti-HEV IgM should be positive in this patient.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
