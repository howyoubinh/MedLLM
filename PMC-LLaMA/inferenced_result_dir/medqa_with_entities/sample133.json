    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for erectile dysfunction. He states that for the past month he has been unable to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife despite having appropriate sexual desire. He also endorses deep and burning buttock and hip pain when walking, which is relieved by rest. The patient states that he does not have erections at night or in the morning. His past medical history is notable for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and he has a 40 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam is notable for weak lower extremity and femoral pulses. Which of the following is the most specific etiology of this patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Anxiety",
      "B": "Aortoiliac atherosclerosis",
      "C": "Spinal stenosis",
      "D": "Vascular claudication"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms of erectile dysfunction and buttock and hip pain with exertion are consistent with a diagnosis of vasculogenic erectile dysfunction. His physical exam findings of diminished femoral pulses suggest aortoiliac atherosclerosis, which can cause arterial insufficiency and subsequent erectile dysfunction. Spinal stenosis can cause erectile dysfunction, but the patient’s symptoms of buttock and hip pain with exertion make this diagnosis less likely. Anxiety can cause erectile dysfunction, but it would not explain the buttock and hip pain with exertion. Vascular claudication can cause buttock and hip pain with exertion, but it would not explain the patient’s symptoms of erectile dysfunction.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
