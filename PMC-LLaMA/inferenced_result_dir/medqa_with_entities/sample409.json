    "question": "A 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of tingling in her feet and poor balance. Her only medication is levothyroxine. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and an ataxic gait. Proprioception and sense of vibration are decreased in her toes bilaterally. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels. Histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa. Which of the following structures is most likely being targeted by antibodies in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Islet cell cytoplasm",
      "B": "Deamidated gliadin peptide",
      "C": "Parietal cells",
      "D": "Smooth muscle"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has type A gastritis, which is an autoimmune disease that targets the parietal cells of the stomach. The resulting hypochlorhydria leads to achlorhydria, which allows the body to retain vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms. The neurological symptoms are due to demyelination of peripheral nerves. The parietal cells are the source of intrinsic factor, which is required for vitamin B12 absorption. Antibodies to islet cells cytoplasm are found in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptide are found in celiac disease. Antibodies to smooth muscle are found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
