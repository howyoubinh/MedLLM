    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of difficulty swallowing for the past 3 months. He feels solid food getting stuck in his chest behind the sternum when he eats. Drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing. He has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. He has no hoarseness or weight loss. He has had heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole. His past medical history is also significant for asthma and eczema. He takes no medications except for omeprazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Which of the following best explains these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Achalasia",
      "B": "Diffuse esophageal spasm",
      "C": "Eosinophilic esophagitis",
      "D": "Esophageal reflux disease"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Diffuse esophageal spasm is a disorder characterized by intermittent, nonperistaltic contractions of the esophagus that occur either as a primary disorder or secondary to other disease processes, such as GERD. Patients with diffuse esophageal spasm experience dysphagia and chest pain. The dysphagia is nonprogressive and is often associated with the ingestion of certain foods or liquids. The chest pain is usually non-exertional and can be burning or squeezing. The diagnosis is made by esophageal manometry studies. Treatment is often difficult and includes dietary modification, sedatives, and anticholinergic agents. Nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and botulinum toxin have also been used with success. Achalasia is a motor disorder of the esophagus characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter with distal esophageal dilation. It is a rare disorder that can be caused by either primary muscle disease or secondary to Chagas' disease. The dysphagia of achalasia is progressive and is associated with the ingestion of both solids and liquids. The diagnosis is made by esophageal manometry studies. Treatment options include calcium channel blockers, nitrates, botulinum toxin, and surgical myotomy. Eosinophilic esophagitis is an inflammatory disorder of the esophagus characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. It is an increasingly recognized disorder that can be either idiopathic or secondary to other diseases, such as asthma or GERD. Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis experience dysphagia and chest pain. The diagnosis is made by esophageal biopsy. Treatment includes dietary modification and the use of anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids. Esophageal reflux disease is a common condition characterized by the backward flow of gastric contents into the esophagus. It is often associated with heaburn and regurgitation. Dysphagia is not a common symptom of GERD. The diagnosis is made by upper endoscopy with biopsy. Treatment includes lifestyle modification, high-dose proton pump inhibitors, and, in some cases, surgical intervention.\n\n### Gerard J. Criner, MD</s><s>",
