    "question": "A 20-day-old child is brought to the emergency department by her parents. They are concerned about lethargy and easy bruising. Her mother reports that she has been eating less for the past few days. Today she was difficult to arouse. She normally nurses four-five times a day, but ate less yesterday and this morning. The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care. This is her first visit to a physician of any type. The family is carefully questioned and child abuse is ruled out. The daughter’s pulse is 97/min, respirations are 35/min, temperature is 35.8°C (96.4°F), and blood pressure is 71/46 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae and bruising. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection",
      "B": "Hepatitis B infection",
      "C": "Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency",
      "D": "Vitamin K deficiency"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This child’s history of minimal prenatal care, poor feeding, lethargy, bruising, and petechiae strongly suggest congenital viral infection, most likely cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is the most common cause of congenital viral infection in the United States. It is a ubiquitous virus that is transmitted transplacentally to the fetus in about 50% of cases. Most infected infants are asymptomatic at birth. A small percentage of infants have cytomegalic inclusion disease (CID). CID is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, hemolytic anemia, petechiae, and bruising. The central nervous system (CNS) may also be involved. CID may be suspected on the basis of the clinical findings, but the diagnosis is made by detecting CMV in the urine or saliva. GBS infection (choice A) is uncommon in this age group. Hepatitis B infection (choice B) does not cause the findings described. Although thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency (choice C) can cause developmental delay, it does not cause the other findings described. Vitamin K deficiency (choice D) can cause bleeding, but it does not cause the other findings described.Diagnosis: Congenital CMV infection\n\n### OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
