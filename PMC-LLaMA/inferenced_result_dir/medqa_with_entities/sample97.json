    "question": "A 26-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of burning with urination, penile discharge, and intermittent fevers. A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. The patient is prescribed a course of ceftriaxone and the infection resolves without further complication. One year later, the patient returns with the same infection. Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Exotoxin release",
      "B": "Antigenic variation",
      "C": "Polysaccharide capsule",
      "D": "Bruton's agammaglobulinemia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the patient has reinfection due to antigenic variation. N. gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that is the causative agent of gonorrhea. The organism is oxidase positive and aerobic. It is a fastidious organism that grows well on chocolate agar and Thayer-Martin agar. The latter contains vancomycin, which is effective against contaminating organisms. N. gonorrhoeae produces a protease that cleaves immunoglobulin A1 in the secretions, which may prevent attachment of the organism by host immunoglobulins. The organism also releases an endotoxin, which may contribute to the inflammatory response. N. gonorrhoeae is a non-spore-forming, non-capsulated organism. However, it does have a polysaccharide capsule on some strains, which may contribute to virulence. The polysaccharide capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae is an example of a virulence factor related to capsule formation. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a congenital immunodeficiency that results in a lack of B-cells and immunoglobulins. This would not predispose the patient to reinfection with N. gonorrhoeae. The other choices are not relevant to gonococcal infection.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
