    "question": "A 61-year-old man comes to the physician with several months of sharp, shooting pain in both legs. Twenty years ago, he had a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment. He has no history of serious illness. Examination shows small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the distal lower extremities. Patellar reflexes are absent bilaterally. His gait is unsteady and broad-based. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Atrioventricular block",
      "B": "Mitral valve regurgitation",
      "C": "Penile squamous cell carcinoma",
      "D": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a form of autonomic neuropathy associated with a loss of sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation to the heart, bladder, and bowel. The most common cause of this syndrome is diabetes mellitus. Patients are at risk for orthostatic hypotension, atrioventricular conduction block, gastrointestinal dysfunction, urinary retention, and erectile dysfunction. Mitral valve regurgitation is not associated with autonomic neuropathy. Penile squamous cell carcinoma is a possible complication of untreated syphilis, which can cause neuropathy. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is associated with atherosclerosis, which is not related to autonomic neuropathy. Trigeminal neuralgia is not associated with autonomic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
