    "question": "A 56-year-old woman presents to a physician with severe pain and swelling of the left inguinal area for 3 days. She has a fever and malaise. Last week she noted several painless red papules on her left thigh when she was on a summer trip to Madagascar. She has no history of serious illnesses and is on no medications. There has been no recent contact with any animals or pets. The temperature is 38.6℃ (101.5℉), the pulse is 78/min, the respiration rate is 12/min, and the blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Swelling of the left inguinal area was noted; however, there were no skin changes. Several large, tense, and tender lymph nodes with a boggy consistency were palpated in the inguinal region. The right inguinal area is normal on physical exam. There was no lymphadenopathy in other areas. No abnormalities existed in the lungs, heart, and abdomen. Microscopic examination of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes revealed gram-negative Coccobacilli. Serum anti-F1 titers show a 4-fold rise. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Azithromycin",
      "B": "Imipenem",
      "C": "Streptomycin",
      "D": "No pharmacotherapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical picture is suggestive of bubonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis. The woman most likely acquired the infection while on her trip to Madagascar, where plague is endemic. The anti-F1 titers indicate prior exposure to Yersinia pestis. The drug of choice for treatment of plague is streptomycin. Alternative drugs include gentamicin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Imipenem is a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic that is effective against Yersinia pestis. Azithromycin is an alternative drug for the treatment of plague.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
