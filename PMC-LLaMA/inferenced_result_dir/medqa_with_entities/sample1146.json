    "question": "A 27-year-old male presents for emergency surgery to reattach his left arm, severed during a high-speed car accident, and has lost significant amounts of blood. His wife arrives within minutes to the hospital exclaiming that under no circumstance should he receive any blood transfusions during surgery. After reviewing his medical chart, you see also see an annotation indicating no blood transfusions for religious reasons. Knowing that he needs a blood transfusion to save his life, what do you do?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer a blood transfusion to save the patient's life",
      "B": "Call the ethics board of the hospital to discuss the issue",
      "C": "Respect the patient's written instructions and do not adminster a blood transfusion",
      "D": "Convince the wife to administer a blood transfusion to her husband"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "As a physician, your primary concern is to save the patient's life. In this scenario, the patient is unable to communicate his wishes and his wife has given consent to perform the surgery, but has requested that no blood transfusions be given. As a physician, you are obligated to provide necessary treatment to save the patient's life, even if it means going against the patient's written wishes. In this case, you should call the hospital ethics board to help guide you through this difficult situation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
