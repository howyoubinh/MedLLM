    "question": "A 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Affective symptoms",
      "B": "Being single",
      "C": "Male sex",

  "model_response": "The patient is showing symptoms of schizophrenia. The prognostic factors for schizophrenia are: 1. Good prognostic factors: Acute onset, late age of onset, good premorbid adjustment, catatonic subtype, short duration, positive symptoms, family history of mood disorder, first episode, female sex, good social support, normal brain CT scan, good treatment compliance, good self-care, good social support, good coping skills, and good prognosis if treated. 2. Poor prognostic factors: Poor premorbid adjustment, chronic course, insidious onset, early age of onset, negative symptoms, family history of schizophrenia, past history of schizophrenia, poor treatment compliance, poor self-care, single (not married), male sex, poor social support, and poor prognosis if untreated.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
