    "question": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 3 weeks. The palpitations are accompanied by chest pain that is sharp and localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The patient does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on the weekends. She appears nervous. Her pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Examination shows a fine tremor on both hands and digital swelling. There is retraction of the left upper eyelid. A systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right upper sternal border. The extremities are warm, and pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Propranolol",
      "B": "Digoxin",
      "C": "Amiodarone",
      "D": "Warfarin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The irregularly irregular pulse suggests atrial fibrillation (AF). The elevated heart rate and blood pressure suggest a hyperkinetic state. The fine tremor is suggestive of hyperthyroidism. The eyelid retraction suggests hyperthyroidism as well. The ectopic beat and the intermittent nature of the symptoms suggest the possibility of paroxysmal AF with a rapid ventricular response. The ejection murmur suggests the possibility of associated valvular heart disease. The most likely diagnosis is paroxysmal AF with a rapid ventricular response and ectopic beats. The initial treatment should be to slow the ventricular rate with a beta blocker. Propranolol is a nonselective beta blocker and will also treat the ectopic beats. Digoxin is also effective in treating the ventricular rate in AF, but it has no effect on ectopic beats. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic and will treat ectopic beats, but it will also slow the ventricular rate. Warfarin is an anticoagulant and is indicated for patients in AF who have a risk factor for embolic stroke.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
