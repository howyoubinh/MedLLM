    "question": "A 59-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider complaining of diffuse bodily aches. She reports a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips that is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She was admitted to the hospital earlier in the year after falling in her front yard and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, she is well-appearing with mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips. She has mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction. She has full range of motion in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Serum findings are notable for the following:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 141 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.8 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 22 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL\nGlucose: 110 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.12 mg/dL\nCa2+: 11.2 mg/dL\nPhosphate: 2.3 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.9 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase: 120 U/L\n\nA radiograph of this patient’s right hip would most likely reveal which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins",
      "B": "Medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone",
      "C": "Poorly marginated lesion extending into adjacent soft tissue",
      "D": "Well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A. This patient’s laboratory studies show hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia and increased alkaline phosphatase. The combination of diffuse body aches, hypercalcemia, and a lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins in the setting of renal osteodystrophy is consistent with metastatic bone disease. This patient has a history of breast cancer, which is a common cause of osteoblastic metastases.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
