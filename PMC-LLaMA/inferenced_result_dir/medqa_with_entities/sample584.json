    "question": "A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 and is subsequently intubated. Physical exam is notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Needle decompression and chest tube placement are performed, and the patient is stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood and 2 liters of fluid. Chest radiography demonstrates proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the trauma intensive care unit. On the unit, a repeat chest radiograph is notable for a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inappropriate chest tube placement",
      "B": "Spontaneous pneumothorax",
      "C": "Tension pneumothorax",
      "D": "Tracheobronchial rupture"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a tracheobronchial injury resulting in a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. Tracheobronchial injuries should be suspected in any patient with a pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema, as well as in those with a history of penetrating trauma to the thoracic cage. Inappropriate chest tube placement would not be associated with a recurrent pneumothorax. A spontaneous pneumothorax would not be associated with subcutaneous emphysema or a history of trauma. Tension pneumothorax and tracheobronchial rupture are associated with severe blunt chest trauma and present with signs of tension physiology, including hypotension and tracheal deviation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
