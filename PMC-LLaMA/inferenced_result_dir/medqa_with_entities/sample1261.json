    "question": "A 55-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care doctor with fever, fatigue, and bleeding gums for the past 3 days. She denies any sick contacts. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical exam reveals several oral mucosal petechiae, bleeding gums, bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Initial laboratory workup shows the following:\n\nLeukocyte count and differential:\nLeukocyte count: 6,600/mm^3\nSegmented neutrophils: 60%\nBands: 20%\nEosinophils: 9%\nBasophils: 1%\nLymphocytes: 0%\nMonocytes: 10%\nPlatelet count: 99,000/mm^3\n\nHemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL\nHematocrit: 25%\n\nProthrombin time: 25 sec\nPartial thromboplastin time: 50 sec\nInternational normalized ratio: 1.6\nD-dimer: 2,000 µg/mL\nFibrinogen: 99 mg/dL\n\nA bone marrow biopsy demonstrates 34% myeloblasts with Auer rods that are myeloperoxidase positive. What is best treatment option?",
