    "question": "A 62-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Left circumflex",
      "B": "Diagonal perforators",
      "C": "Septal perforators",
      "D": "Right main"

  },
  "model_response": "The septal perforators arise from the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The LAD supplies the anterior 2/3 of the interventricular septum. The left circumflex artery supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle and the posteromedial 1/3 of the interventricular septum. The diagonal perforators arise from the left anterior descending artery and supply the anterior wall of the left ventricle. The right main coronary artery supplies the right atrium and ventricle and the posterior 1/3 of the interventricular septum.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
