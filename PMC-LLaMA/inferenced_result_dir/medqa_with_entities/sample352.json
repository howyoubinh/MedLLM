    "question": "Five days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia while on a trip to Haiti, a 43-year-old woman develops low-grade fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. During the surgery, she received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Three days after the surgery, she was stable enough to be transported back to the United States. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 138/76 mm Hg. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. Abdominal examination shows moderate tenderness over the liver. The liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin count 12.0 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 10,400 mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 55%\nBands 1%\nEosinophils 13%\nLymphocytes 28%\nMonocytes 3%\nPlatelet count 160,000 mm3\nSerum\nAlkaline phosphatase 102 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase 760 U/L\nBilirubin\nTotal 3.8 mg/dL\nDirect 3.1 mg/dL\nAnti-HAV IgG positive\nAnti-HAV IgM negative\nAnti-HBs positive\nHBsAg negative\nAnti-HCV antibodies negative\nAbdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?\"",
