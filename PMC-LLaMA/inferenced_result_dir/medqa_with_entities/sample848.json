    "question": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of worsening pain, discoloration, and swelling of her right hand. Two days ago, she was camping outdoors in Texas with her two young children. She was awoken in the middle of the night by “something crawling on my hand.” The following morning, she saw a wound on her hand that was initially painless, but over the next several hours she noticed reddening and blistering. Yesterday, the lesion turned blue with a blackish discoloration at the center. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema at the dorsum of the right hand. Which of the following animals is most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Diamondback rattlesnake",
      "B": "Brown recluse spider",
      "C": "Striped bark scorpion",
      "D": "Deer tick"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A (Diamondback rattlesnake). The patient's symptoms are consistent with a pit viper envenomation, in this case a diamondback rattlesnake. The rattlesnake's venom is predominantly myotoxic, and the patient's physical examination findings of a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema are consistent with a localized area of tissue necrosis. The rattlesnake's venom is also thrombogenic, and the patient's history of worsening pain, discoloration, and swelling are consistent with the development of thrombophlebitis. The patient's temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) is also consistent with the effects of snake venom. The diamondback rattlesnake is found throughout the southern United States, including Texas. The brown recluse spider (choice B) is associated with the development of a necrotic skin ulcer and the black widow spider (choice E) causes muscle rigidity and pain. The other choices do not cause the constellation of findings seen in this patient.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
