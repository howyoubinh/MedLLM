    "question": "A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, and irritability for the past week. She has been unable to recall her husband's name or their address. She has had insomnia and daytime sleepiness during this period. Her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. One month ago, she underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) placement. She has alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Current medications include spironolactone and furosemide. She used to drink over a pint of vodka daily but quit 2 months ago. She is oriented to place and person. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 102/64 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There are several telangiectasias over the chest and back. Palmar erythema is present. The abdomen is mildly distended and nontender. Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. She completes the number connection test slower than the age-normalized standard. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Reversal of TIPS",
      "B": "Paracentesis",
      "C": "Administer IV ceftriaxone",
      "D": "Administer lactulose"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical features described are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of chronic liver disease. The precipitating factor in this case is likely the TIPS procedure. The elevated ammonia level is characteristic. The next step in management is to administer lactulose, a nonabsorbable disaccharide that acts as an osmotic laxative to reduce ammonia absorption in the gut. Poor performance on number connection tests is an early sign of encephalopathy. Reversal of the TIPS is unlikely to be helpful. The patient does not have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, so there is no need for antibiotics.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
