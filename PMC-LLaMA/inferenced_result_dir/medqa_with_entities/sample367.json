    "question": "A 22-year-old gravida 1 presents to her physician at 15 weeks gestation for a prenatal appointment. She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6℃ (99.7℉). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient’s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted. The knee joints appear normal.\nSerology performed 1 year ago Current serology\nRubella IgM - negative Rubella IgM - negative\nRubella IgG - 1:128 Rubella IgG - 1:64\nRubella IgG avidity - high Rubella IgG avidity - high\nWhat is the proper next step in the management of this woman?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum",
      "B": "Recommend pregnancy termination",
      "C": "Arrange a chorionic villus sampling",
      "D": "Recommend additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The woman has a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over her trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted. The knee joints appear normal. Her serology shows that she has a high avidity for rubella, indicating that she had a previous infection with rubella and is immune. Her current IgM rubella is negative, which means that she does not have an acute rubella infection. Her current IgG rubella is 1:64, which is considered low avidity. The current rubella IgG avidity test result is high. The proper next step in the management of this woman is to arrange a chorionic villus sampling. The fetus is at risk for congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Chorionic villus sampling is performed at 10 to 12 weeks' gestation and allows for early detection of CRS. If the results are positive for CRS, then pregnancy termination may be considered. If the results are negative for CRS, then the woman can be reassured and vaccinated postpartum.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
