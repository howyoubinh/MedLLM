    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has not attained menarche. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 168 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 63 kg (139 lb); BMI is 22.3 kg/m2. Examination shows normal breast development. Scant axillary hair is present. Abdominal examination shows a firm, nontender left inguinal mass. Pelvic examination shows a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "5-α reductase deficiency",
      "B": "Sex chromosome mosaicism",
      "C": "Sex chromosome monosomy",
      "D": "Androgen insensitivity"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a testicular disorder, as indicated by the presence of a left inguinal mass. Testicular disorders in boys can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. True hermaphroditism, in which both ovarian and testicular tissues are present. This is a very rare condition.\n\n2. Gonadal dysgenesis, in which there is a failure of genetic or environmental factors that prevent normal sexual differentiation. The most common form of gonadal dysgenesis is Turner syndrome, in which there is an XO genotype.\n\n3. Testicular feminization, in which there is a genetic defect that impairs testosterone synthesis. The most common form of testicular feminization is the androgen insensitivity syndrome, in which a genetic defect leads to a failure of the peripheral tissues to respond to androgens. Because the end-organ resistance to androgens prevents normal masculinization of the external genitalia in utero, affected individuals appear female. Gonads are testes, and the internal genitalia consist of a blind vaginal pouch, absent uterus, and bilateral seminiferous tubules or undifferentiated gonadal tissue.\n\n4. Testicular dysgenesis, in which there is a failure of normal testicular development. This can be caused by genetic defects, such as 5-α-reductase deficiency, or environmental factors, such as cryptorchidism.\n\nIn 5-α-reductase deficiency, affected individuals have a male karyotype (46,XY), normally functioning testes, and high levels of circulating testosterone. However, the testosterone is ineffective in masculinizing the external genitalia because it is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5-α-reductase. DHT is the most potent androgen, and its deficiency leads to ambiguous external genitalia in affected males.\n\nIn summary, this patient has a blind vaginal pouch, indicating the absence of a uterus and functional ovaries. The presence of scant axillary hair and a firm, nontender inguinal mass indicates that testes are present and that testosterone has been produced. The most likely underlying cause of these findings is 5-α-reductase deficiency, which impairs the masculinization of the external genitalia.\n\nThe other options are not likely causes of this patient's symptoms. Sex chromosome mosaicism and monosomy are associated with gonadal dysgenesis and the absence of testes. In such cases, the internal and external genitalia are female. Sex chromosome superfemale (XO/XO) mosaicism is a cause of Turner syndrome, which is characterized by a webbed neck, short stature, and external and internal genitalia that are female. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a cause of testicular feminization, in which the internal and external genitalia are female.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
