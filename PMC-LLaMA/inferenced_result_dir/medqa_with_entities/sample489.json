    "question": "A 62-year-old man with a history of chronic bronchitis comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of worsening shortness of breath and cough productive of thick sputum. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Physical examination shows an increased anteroposterior chest diameter and coarse crackles in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Treatment with a drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is begun. Which of the following drugs was most likely started?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Fluticasone",
      "B": "Montelukast",
      "C": "Tiotropium",
      "D": "Cromolyn"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The symptoms described are those of COPD, and theophylline preparations, which directly antagonize the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways, are the most effective bronchodilators for this disease. The other listed drugs are used in the treatment of asthma, which is characterized by reversible airway obstruction.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

In emergency and/or for short-time use, esophageal obturation with one- or two-lumen tubes and oropharyngeal artificial airways are typically used. For a few days of intubation, nasopharyngeal artificial airways are the most commonly used devices, while for longer periods (up to three weeks) endotracheal tubes are the preferred devices. When long-term mechanical ventilation is needed, tracheostomy tubes are used. Artificial airways are available in a variety of configurations from newborn to adult sizes."
