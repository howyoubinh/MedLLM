    "question": "A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 42 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her two other children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (200 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg. Examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Polyhydramnios",
      "B": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome",
      "C": "Meconium aspiration",
      "D": "Placental abruption"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is at risk for gestational diabetes, which is associated with fetal macrosomia. Macrosomia is defined as a fetal size exceeding 4,000 g. The incidence of macrosomia increases with the duration of the pregnancy. The average birth weight of a fetus born at 42 weeks' gestation is 4,300 g. The incidence of gestational diabetes is approximately 15% in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes. The incidence of macrosomia is approximately 25% in patients with gestational diabetes. The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome approaches 30% in infants born to diabetic mothers. The incidence of polyhydramnios is 20% in infants of diabetic mothers. Meconium aspiration occurs in 10% of infants of diabetic mothers. Placental abruption is not specifically associated with diabetes.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
