    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Plays a role in angioedema",
      "B": "Degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor",
      "C": "Creates pores in the cell membrane",
      "D": "Induces the alternative complement pathway"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a history of meningitis and pneumococcal infection, which are both indicative of defects in the complement system. The complement system is composed of a large number of proteins that, when activated, create pores in cell membranes, induce the alternative complement pathway, and degrade other complement components. The complement system can be activated by either the classical or alternative pathways. The classical pathway is initiated by antibody binding to an antigen, which then activates C1 to create C1 esterase, which in turn cleaves C2 and initiates the complement cascade. The alternative complement pathway is activated by the binding of various substances, such as endotoxin, to various receptors on immune cells. The end result of complement activation is the creation of pores in the cell membrane, leading to cell lysis. The complement system also plays a role in angioedema and in the recruitment of various immune cells. C1 esterase inhibitor is a protein that inhibits the activity of the early complement components, and is deficient in patients with hereditary angioedema.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
