    "question": "A 40-year-old male presents to your office complaining that he is too weak to climb stairs or brush his hair. He denies any headaches or change in vision. A muscle biopsy reveals CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Systemic lupus erythematosus",
      "B": "Polymyalgia rheumatica",
      "C": "Polymyositis",

  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms of weakness and the muscle biopsy findings are consistent with polymyositis, an inflammatory myopathy. The other choices do not feature CD8+ lymphocytes. Systemic lupus erythematosus can feature lymphocyte infiltration, but it is not typically CD8+. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a disorder of older individuals that features stiffness and pain in the shoulders, hips, and pelvis. Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that features a characteristic skin rash.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
