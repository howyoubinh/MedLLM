    "question": "A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with fatigue, a progressively worsening cough with flecks of blood, shortness of breath, and dark urine. He reports feeling ill for the past 3 weeks. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes chlorthalidone and atorvastatin. Family history is noncontributory. He has smoked 20–30 cigarettes daily for the past 26 years. Anti-glomerular basement membrane serologies are positive. Which of the following is a specific feature for this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis",
      "B": "Positive cryoglobulins",
      "C": "Linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence",
      "D": "Longitudinal splitting and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical and laboratory features are most consistent with a diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome. This rare autoimmune disease is characterized by a proliferative, usually rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and necrotizing vasculitis of the lungs. The latter can result in hemoptysis, which is usually the major clinical manifestation. The disease is mediated by antibodies targeted against the noncollagenous domain of the a3 chain of collagen IV. These antibodies can be detected in the serum of more than 90% of patients with Goodpasture syndrome. The characteristic linear pattern of immunoglobulin deposition (usually IgG, sometimes IgA or IgM) that is the hallmark diagnostic finding on renal biopsy immunofluorescence is not specific for Goodpasture syndrome. It is also seen in other autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) and in some patients with the nephritic syndrome attributable to various other causes. The other choices are not specific for Goodpasture syndrome.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
