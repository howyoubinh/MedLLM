    "question": "A 41-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. His wife found him on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of medication next to him. He has a history of major depressive disorder. His only medication is nortriptyline. His pulse is 127/min and blood pressure is 90/61 mm Hg. Examination shows dilated pupils and dry skin. The abdomen is distended and there is dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region. An ECG shows tachycardia and a QRS complex width of 130 ms. In addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Naloxone",
      "B": "Cyproheptadine",
      "C": "Ammonium chloride",
      "D": "Sodium bicarbonate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'R': 'Naloxone 0.4 mg IV (or 0.8 mg IV if no response) followed by 0.4-2 mg IV every 2-3 hours as needed to a maximum of 10 mg. If no response is seen with 10 mg of naloxone, the diagnosis is probably not morphine or tricyclic overdose. In such cases, the diagnosis should be reconsidered and other causes of CNS depression and respiratory depression should be explored. Naloxone should be titrated with caution in patients who are chronic users of opioids. Overdoses of tramadol may respond to naloxone administration.'}\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
