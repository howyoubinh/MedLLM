    "question": "A previously healthy 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise for the last 6 months. She does not smoke. Her maternal uncle had similar symptoms. Cardiac examination shows wide splitting of S2. The second component of S2 is loud and best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased right ventricular preload",
      "B": "Increased left ventricular preload",
      "C": "Increased right ventricular afterload",
      "D": "Increased left-to-right shunting"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a wide fixed split of S2, which is characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD). The right ventricular volume overload produced by the left-to-right shunt of blood results in an increase in right ventricular preload. The increased volume of blood in the right ventricle produces an increase in right ventricular stroke volume and a wide pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic pressure). The left ventricular volume overload that occurs in ASD does not result in an increase in left ventricular preload because the shunt of blood occurs after the mitral valve has closed. The left ventricle does, however, have an increase in stroke volume because it pumps blood that it receives from the right ventricle through the left-to-right shunt. The left ventricular afterload is not affected by the presence of an ASD.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
