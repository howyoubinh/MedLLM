    "question": "A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath. He notes that he stopped taking his furosemide two weeks prior, because he ran out of pills. On exam, his oxygen saturation is 78%, his lungs have crackles throughout, and jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe. EKG and troponin levels are normal. Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, normal diffusion distance",
      "B": "Decreased Aa gradient, increased surface area for diffusion, decreased diffusion distance",
      "C": "Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance",
      "D": "Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has congestive heart failure, which has led to pulmonary edema. The increased left atrial pressure leads to an increased pulmonary capillary pressure, which in turn results in transudation of fluid into the lung interstitium and alveoli. The diffusion distance is increased because the lung is wet. The surface area for diffusion is likely normal, although it may be decreased if there is destruction of the pulmonary architecture. The A-a gradient is normal because the normal alveolar-arterial gradient is 5-15 mm Hg, and the patient has no significant V/Q mismatch.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
