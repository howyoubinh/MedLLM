    "question": "A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alprazolam",
      "B": "Cognitive behavioral therapy",
      "C": "Fluoxetine",
      "D": "Psychodynamic psychotherapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s fear of flying is consistent with a diagnosis of specific phobia. The avoidance of air travel is leading to functional impairment and the patient recognizes the irrationality of his fear. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice for specific phobias. CBT involves education about the irrationality of fears, identification of maladaptive thoughts, and changing behaviors to overcome the fear. Medications, such as alprazolam, can be used for short-term relief of anxiety, but long-term management involves behavioral therapy. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that may be used in the treatment of specific phobias, but it is not the first-line treatment. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is not the treatment of choice for specific phobias.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
