    "question": "A 60-year-old man with severe persistent asthma since the age of 14 presents with an acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing over the last several days. His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. Which of the following is most likely to be associated with the recent loss of asthma control in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Airway epithelial shedding",
      "B": "Airway smooth muscle atrophy",
      "C": "Airway remodeling",
      "D": "Airway hyperresponsiveness"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is C (Airway remodeling). Loss of asthma control in a patient with long-standing asthma is often associated with the development of airway remodeling. Airway remodeling is characterized by an increase in the size of the airway smooth muscle, an increase in the size of the submucosal glands, and an increase in the thickness of the epithelial reticular basement membrane. Airway remodeling is associated with an increased risk of death and a blunted response to bronchodilators. Airway epithelial shedding (choice A) is not associated with loss of asthma control. Diagnosis: Asthma\n\n### COMMENTS: This question is a bit unusual in that the correct answer is not one of the choices. The correct answer is airway remodeling. The other choices are features of airway remodeling. Airway epithelial shedding is a feature of airway remodeling. Airway smooth muscle atrophy is not a feature of airway remodeling. Airway smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia are features of airway remodeling. Airway remodeling is associated with an increased risk of death and a blunted response to bronchodilators.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
