    "question": "A 34-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up in the oncology clinic after his second cycle of chemotherapy. In addition to intermittent nausea, he has mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand. With his affected hand, he is able to grip, but occasionally drops small objects. His oncologist tells him that one of his chemotherapy agents likely caused his neuropathy given its strong association with neurotoxicity. He was recently treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib. The culprit medication works by which of the following mechanisms of action?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Covalently X-links DNA",
      "B": "Blocks microtubule formation",
      "C": "Intercalates between DNA",
      "D": "Modifies DNA transcription and protein synthesis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with a peripheral neuropathy, which is a common side effect of the chemotherapy agent vincristine. Vincristine works by inhibiting the formation of microtubules in growing cells, thereby disrupting mitosis and ultimately leading to cell death. The other listed mechanisms of action are not associated with vincristine. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that covalently links DNA, doxorubicin is a topoisomerase inhibitor that intercalates between DNA strands, and dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that modifies DNA transcription and protein synthesis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
