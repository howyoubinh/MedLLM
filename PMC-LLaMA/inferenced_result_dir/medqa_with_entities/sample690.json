    "question": "A 67-year old man presents to his primary care physician for his yearly checkup. He has not noticed any major changes in his health over the last year but says that unfortunately, he stopped exercising because he has been stressed by work. His past medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking a number of drugs but does not remember what they are. A panel of metabolic and lipid tests are ordered and show worsening of his metabolic parameters. Based on these findings, his physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and decrease in low-density lipoproteins. The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is associated with which of the following side effects?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cholelithiasis",
      "B": "Decreased vitamin D absorption",
      "C": "Hepatotoxicity",
      "D": "Teratogenicity"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The drug prescribed was probably a statin, which are known to cause small increases in liver enzymes in a small percentage of patients. They also have a small risk of causing myopathy. They have no known effects on vitamin D metabolism. They have no known effects on carbohydrate or protein metabolism. They have no known effects on fertility.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
