    "question": "A 63-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for follow-up. He reports a slow and steady weight gain of 6 pounds over the past 6 months, despite attempts to control his diet and increase his level of exercise. His medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. On exam, his vital signs are stable. He is obese (BMI 32), and his waist circumference is 43 inches. His physician is concerned about an abnormal fasting blood glucose and dyslipidemia. On further work-up with oral glucose tolerance test, the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. Which of the following associations is consistent with this patient’s most likely form of diabetes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Strong HLA class II gene makeup",
      "B": "Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition",
      "C": "Pancreatic islet cell leukocyte infiltration",
      "D": "Auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s presentation is most consistent with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). DM2 is strongly associated with obesity, particularly visceral obesity, and with insulin resistance. The pathogenesis of DM2 involves a complex interplay between underlying resistance to the action of insulin in its metabolic targets (liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue) and a reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Genetic factors are important, and there is a strong concordance of DM2 in identical twins. Type 1 DM (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens and T-cell infiltration of the pancreatic islets. T1DM is not associated with obesity.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
