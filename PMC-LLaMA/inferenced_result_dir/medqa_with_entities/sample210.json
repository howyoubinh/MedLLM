    "question": "An investigator is studying the effect of drug X on the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene on chromosome 13 in endometrial cells. Endometrial cells obtained from study participants are plated on growth media and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured with flow cytometry. Drug X, which is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, is administered to all the cells, and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured again 1 hour later. Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene?",
    "options": {
      "A": "G1 phase arrest",
      "B": "Prophase I arrest",
      "C": "Initiation of S phase",
      "D": "Completion of G2 phase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The G1 checkpoint is regulated by the Rb gene product, which binds to the transcription factor E2F and prevents the cell from entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 will phosphorylate the Rb protein, releasing E2F and allowing the cell to enter the S phase. Therefore, administration of drug X will most likely result in a decrease in the number of cells in G1 phase and an increase in the number of cells in S phase.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
