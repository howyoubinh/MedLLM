    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of facial swelling that started 5 days ago. Two weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved spontaneously. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 94/67 mm Hg. Examination shows pitting edema of the upper and lower extremities as well as periorbital edema. The abdomen is mildly distended. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.1 g/dL\nSerum\nAlbumin 2.1 g/dL\nTotal cholesterol 270 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 175 mg/dL\nUrine\nBlood negative\nGlucose negative\nProtein 4+\nLeukocyte esterase negative\nA renal biopsy of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Mesangial proliferation on light microscopy",
      "B": "Subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy",
      "C": "Deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluoresence",
      "D": "Normal light microscopy findings"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is D (Normal light microscopy findings). The clinical presentation of facial swelling, periorbital edema, pitting edema of the upper and lower extremities, and laboratory findings of hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia in a 5-year-old boy suggest a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. The most likely cause of nephrotic syndrome in a child of this age is minimal change disease. Light microscopy in this disease is typically normal. Electron microscopy may show nondescript effacement of the foot processes. Immunofluoresence may be negative, or it may show deposits of IgG and C3 in the mesangium. A renal biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of minimal change disease. The diagnosis can be made by less invasive tests such as lipid studies, complement levels, and urinalysis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
