    "question": "A 63-year-old female complains of weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue. She has a past medical history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Her hematocrit is 29%. On peripheral blood smear, you notice neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells. On physical exam, you notice the patient has decreased position sense and a loss in vibratory sensation in her lower extremities. Which of the following is most likely present in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Atrophy of G cells",
      "B": "Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies",
      "C": "Decreased methylmalonic acid levels",
      "D": "Antithrombotic state"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s symptoms are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. The macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms are classic. The tongue soreness is likely glossitis secondary to the deficiency. The intrinsic factor (IF) is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum. In this patient, the likely cause of the deficiency is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, which can be associated with pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune atrophic process that affects the body’s ability to absorb vitamin B12. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are present in 90% of patients with pernicious anemia. The deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to a megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms. The anemia is macrocytic and the red blood cells are oval-shaped. The macrocytes are larger than 7 microns, hence the term macrocytic. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is usually greater than 100. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is normal. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is usually elevated. The reticulocyte count is low. The serum vitamin B12 level is low and the homocysteine level is elevated. The methylmalonic acid level is elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency. This is due to the accumulation of the byproducts of the metabolism of methylmalonyl-CoA. The accumulation occurs because the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase requires vitamin B12 as a co-factor. The accumulation of methylmalonic acid is toxic to the nervous system. The treatment of choice is vitamin B12 replacement.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
