    "question": "A 25-year-old African American man presents to his primary care provider for routine blood work. He is a well-known case of sickle cell disease treated with hydroxyurea and tramadol as needed for pain. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient asks if his disease can adversely affect his kidneys because his friend was recently diagnosed with end-stage renal failure. Which of the following is a renal complication of sickle cell disease?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Membranous glomerulonephritis",
      "B": "Proximal renal tubular acidosis",
      "C": "Impaired urine diluting ability",
      "D": "Impaired urine concentration ability"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A. Membranous glomerulonephritis. Sickle cell disease is associated with several renal complications. The most common renal abnormality is hyposthenuria (impaired urine concentrating ability). Other renal abnormalities include hematuria, tubular necrosis, and renal medullary carcinoma. Membranous glomerulonephritis is a rare complication of sickle cell disease.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
