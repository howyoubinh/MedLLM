    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with weakness. He states that it started yesterday and has been progressively worsening. Initially, he noticed blurry vision and some trouble speaking and swallowing but thought he was just coming down with a cold. He then noticed weakness of his facial muscles and shortness of breath. The patient works as a farmer and harvests and cans his own foods. He has had diarrhea recently and a cough prior to these symptoms of weakness. His temperature is 97.9°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who seems unable to smile with dysarthric speech. He takes shallow and weak breaths on pulmonary exam. The patient demonstrates 3/5 strength with diminished reflexes in his upper extremities. The patient is subsequently intubated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Antitoxin",
      "B": "Neostigmine",
      "C": "Plasmapheresis",
      "D": "Riluzole"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has the classic presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The initial symptoms are due to a motor neuropathy. Paresthesias may be seen early but are usually not a prominent feature. Subsequently, the patient develops weakness that begins in the lower extremities and progresses to the trunk, upper extremities, and finally the bulbar muscles. In severe cases, respiratory muscles may be involved early. The disease process usually spreads over 7 days. The initial symptoms are usually followed by a plateau of about 7 days, with recovery beginning 1-2 weeks following the initial symptoms. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein with a normal cell count. The CSF is usually obtained via a lumbar spinal puncture. The treatment of choice is usually intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Plasmapheresis is also used in severe cases. Corticosteroids have not been shown to be effective. Antitoxin is not used because of the presumed immune-mediated pathogenesis of the disease. Riluzole is not indicated because it is not known to be effective in Guillain-Barre syndrome.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
