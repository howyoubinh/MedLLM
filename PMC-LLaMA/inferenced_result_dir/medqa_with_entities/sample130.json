    "question": "A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show:\nBilirubin\nTotal 15 mg/dL\nDirect 12.3 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L\nAST 53 U/L\nALT 45 U/L\nγ-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L\nBlood group A positive\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Galactosemia",
      "B": "Biliary atresia",
      "C": "Crigler–Najjar syndrome",
      "D": "Breast milk jaundice"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's laboratory results show a direct bilirubin level higher than the total bilirubin level, which is consistent with obstructive jaundice. The elevated alkaline phosphatase level further supports this diagnosis. The blood group A positive is a coincidental finding. The patient's age and the absence of focal neurologic signs make meningitis unlikely. The patient's age and the mild degree of hyperbilirubinemia make Crigler–Najjar syndrome type I unlikely. The patient's age and the absence of significant hepatomegaly make hepatitis unlikely. The patient's age and the absence of significant hepatomegaly make biliary atresia unlikely. The patient's age and the absence of significant hepatomegaly make Gilbert syndrome unlikely. The patient's age and the absence of significant hepatomegaly make neonatal iron storage disease unlikely. The patient's age and the absence of significant hepatomegaly make microvesicular steatosis unlikely.\n\nGalactosemia\n\nGalactosemia is a disorder of galactose metabolism. Galactose is a monosaccharide that is a component of lactose, the sugar in milk. Galactose is also present in some fruits and vegetables. The disorder is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). The disorder may be suspected in infants with failure to thrive, lethargy, hypotonia, and vomiting. In older children, the disorder may be suspected if there is development of cataracts, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, or intellectual disability. The disorder may be detected in newborn screening programs. Treatment includes a galactose-free diet.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
