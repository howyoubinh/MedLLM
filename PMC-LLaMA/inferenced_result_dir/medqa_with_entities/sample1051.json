    "question": "A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep venous thrombosis is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral anticoagulant. This novel drug has the property where its clearance is relatively predictable based on patient demographics and can easily be extrapolated from other data. Its metabolism and volume of distribution also do not change dramatically from patient to patient. The investigator wants to make sure that the plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L and he knows the following drug characteristics.\n\nBioavailability: 50%\nDrug half-life: 2 hours\nVolume of distribution: 14.3 liters\n\nWhich of the following represents the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours?",
    "options": {
      "A": "150 milligrams",
      "B": "430 milligrams",
      "C": "1200 milligrams",
      "D": "3600 milligrams"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours is 1200 milligrams. The formula for calculating the maintenance dose is: Maintainance dose = (Desired target concentration x volume of distribution) / bioavailability. In this case, the desired target concentration is 15 mg/L, the volume of distribution is 14.3 L, and the bioavailability is 50%. Plugging these values into the equation, the maintenance dose is: 15 mg/L x 14.3 L / 50% = 1200 milligrams.\n\n###OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
