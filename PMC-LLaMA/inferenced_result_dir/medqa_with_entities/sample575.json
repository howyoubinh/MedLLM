    "question": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent pain in her neck, right shoulder, and arm, as well as a tingling sensation in her right hand. She first noticed her symptoms after she got off a rollercoaster ride 2 months ago. Physical examination shows weakness when extending the right wrist against resistance. An MRI of the head and neck is shown. This patient's condition is most likely the result of nerve root compression by a structure derived from which of the following embryologic layers?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Neural crest",
      "B": "Notochord",
      "C": "Neural tube",
      "D": "Surface ectoderm"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a cervical disk herniation with compression of the nerve root exiting the spinal cord between the C6 and C7 vertebrae. The notochord is derived from the mesoderm and is the basis for the development of the vertebral column. The neural crest cells are ectodermal in origin and give rise to the peripheral nervous system, including the nerves and ganglia. The neural tube is ectodermal in origin and gives rise to the central nervous system. The surface ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis of the skin.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
