    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a progressive development of tender breast tissue over the past 18 months. He used to ride his bicycle for exercise 4 times a week but stopped after he had an accident and injured his left testicle 3 months ago. He has gained 5 kg (11 lb) during this period. For the last 10 years, he drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. He occasionally takes pantoprazole for heartburn. He is 171 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 87 kg (192 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilaterally symmetrical, mildly tender gynecomastia. A nontender 1.5-cm mass is palpated in the left testis; transillumination test is negative. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Leydig cell tumor",
      "B": "Obesity",
      "C": "Klinefelter syndrome",
      "D": "Trauma to testis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's obesity and alcohol intake are associated with an increased risk for development of gynecomastia. Testicular trauma can result in a hematoma that mimics the more common gynecomastia. The hematoma resolves spontaneously. Testicular tumors are more common in obese men, but the presentation is usually a testicular mass. Klinefelter syndrome is associated with gynecomastia, but the patient is too old for this condition.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
