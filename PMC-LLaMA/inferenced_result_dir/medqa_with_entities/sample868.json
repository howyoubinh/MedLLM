    "question": "An 80-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fatigue and lightheadedness. He does not have chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing. He has a history of hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and asthma. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, lisinopril, albuterol, and ibuprofen. His pulse is 48/min and blood pressure is 89/50 mm Hg. He responds slowly to questions but is oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. His lungs are clear to auscultation and bowel sounds are positive with no pulsatile masses or bruits. Pedal pulses are nonpalpable, distal extremities are cold, and capillary refill time is 4 seconds. An ECG shows left axis deviation, a Q wave in lead III, a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, and a QRS interval of .09 seconds. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dobutamine",
      "B": "Norepinephrine",
      "C": "Cardiac pacing",
      "D": "Epinephrine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's clinical presentation suggests severe bradycardia. The ECG findings are consistent with complete heart block. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness are likely due to the bradycardia. The elevated CVP suggests fluid depletion due to inadequate cardiac output. The first step in management should be intravenous fluids. If the patient remains hypotensive, inotropic support with dobutamine or dopamine may be necessary. However, the patient's rhythm is likely due to a mechanical cause (complete heart block) and will require a temporary transvenous pacemaker. Epinephrine and norepinephrine will increase peripheral vascular resistance and increase coronary perfusion pressure, but will not correct the underlying problem of inadequate cardiac output due to complete heart block. Cardiac pacing is unlikely to be effective because of the mechanical obstruction at the level of the atrioventricular node.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

It was discovered by Columbus in 1493 but no colonization was attempted until 1508. It belonged to Spain until ceded to the United States in 1898. It became a commonwealth with autonomy in internal affairs in 1952. Columbus named the island San Juan for St. John's Day, the Monday he arrived, and the bay Puerto Rico, rich harbor. The island became Puerto Rico officially in 1932. (From Webster's New Geographical Dictionary, 1988, p987 & Room, Brewer's Dictionary of Names, 1992, p436)"
