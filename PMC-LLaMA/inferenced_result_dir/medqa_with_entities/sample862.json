    "question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a general checkup. She has been doing well in school and has no complaints. The patient has a past medical history of asthma which is controlled with albuterol. She is currently sexually active but states that she uses birth control. She has many friends and states that her mood is typically positive. The patient's last pap smear was 1 year ago. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 68, and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 65. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 147/108 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's BMI is 19 kg/m^2. Physical exam demonstrates a normal S1 and S2, normal breath sounds, and an abdominal exam that is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Colonoscopy",
      "B": "Discontinue birth control and place an intrauterine device",
      "C": "Pap smear",
      "D": "Recommend weight loss"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's BMI is 19 kg/m^2, which is in the normal range. She is currently sexually active and using birth control. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women with a normal BMI should begin cervical cancer screening at the age of 21. Since the patient is 27 years old, it is appropriate to recommend a Pap smear at this time.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
