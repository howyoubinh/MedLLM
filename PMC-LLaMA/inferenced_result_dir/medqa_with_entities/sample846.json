    "question": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of increasing weakness and numbness of the upper extremities for 5 days. During the past 2 days, she has had urinary incontinence not related to sneezing or laughing. Last summer, she had weakness and numbness of her right lower extremity that was worse when she was outside; she regained her strength 3 weeks later. She has no history of serious illness. She has had 10 male sexual partners in her lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an impaired tandem gait. There is mild spasticity and muscle strength is decreased in both upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. The abdominal reflex is absent. Muscle strength in the right lower extremity is mildly decreased. Sensation to vibration and fine touch is decreased over the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Muscle biopsy",
      "B": "Rapid plasma reagin test",
      "C": "MRI of the brain and spine",
      "D": "Lumbar puncture"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical manifestations are consistent with a demyelinating process involving the brain and spinal cord. The most likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis (MS). An MRI of the brain and spine would show multiple hyperintense white matter lesions on T2-weighted images consistent with demyelinating plaques. An increased incidence of MS is associated with a history of infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a history of lower socioeconomic status, and female sex. The CSF in patients with MS usually shows a mild mononuclear pleocytosis. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is a screening test for syphilis. The VDRL is a specific test for syphilis. A muscle biopsy would be appropriate if the clinical examination suggested a muscular dystrophy. A positive test for syphilis would be consistent with tabes dorsalis, but the presentation is not typical.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
