    "question": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and vomiting for 8 hours. He has had around 3–4 episodes of greenish colored vomit during this period. He has major depressive disorder with psychosis. His mother has Graves' disease. Current medications include sertraline and haloperidol. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 87/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. He is diagnosed with acute appendicitis and is taken to the operating room for an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. The appendix is gangrenous and perforated with purulent fluid in the pelvis. Just after the appendiceal base is ligated, the patient shows muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 146/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The end-tidal CO2 is 85 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dantrolene",
      "B": "Bromocriptine",
      "C": "Cyproheptadine",
      "D": "Surgical embolectomy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The symptoms described are consistent with malignant hyperthermia (MH). The MH episode typically occurs during or immediately after anesthesia and may be precipitated by potent inhalational agents, amides, or muscle relaxants. Dantrolene is the drug of choice for treating MH. It is a directly acting muscle relaxant that inhibits Ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. This inhibition prevents the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thereby inhibits muscle contraction. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that is used in the management of hyperprolactinemia. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine with antiserotonergic properties that has been used to prevent the recurrence of malignant hyperthermia. Surgical embolectomy is the treatment of choice for acute arterial embolism.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
