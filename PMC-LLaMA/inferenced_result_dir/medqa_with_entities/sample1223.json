    "question": "A 31-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and myalgia. Her boyfriend says she recently returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. She appears ill and is lethargic. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows jaundice and tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies show the presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies. A liver biopsy performed at this time would most likely show which of the following histopathological findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei",
      "B": "Cystic spaces with scattered areas of cellular debris",
