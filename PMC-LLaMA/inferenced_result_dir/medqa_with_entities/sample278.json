    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient says he feels as if he is unable to take a deep breath. The patient has a past medical history of COPD and a 44-pack-year smoking history. The patient has been admitted before for a similar presentation. His temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 123/min, respirations are 33/min, and oxygen saturation is 80% on room air. The patient is started on 100% oxygen, albuterol, ipratropium, magnesium, and prednisone. The patient claims he is still short of breath. Physical exam reveals bilateral wheezes and poor air movement. His oxygen saturation is 80%. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
