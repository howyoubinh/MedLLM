    "question": "A 39-year-old woman presents with headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg and pulse is 67/min. Blood tests reveal high blood glucose and low potassium level. Abdominal CT scan shows a well-circumscribed homogeneous mass in the left adrenal gland. The hormone excess responsible for her symptoms uses which of the following pathways to exert its action?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Intracellular receptors",
      "B": "cAMP pathway",
      "C": "cGMP pathway",
      "D": "JAK/STAT pathway"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical picture is consistent with a diagnosis of aldosterone-secreting adenoma. Aldosterone acts on the renal tubular cells, causing increased reabsorption of sodium and increased secretion of potassium. The increased reabsorption of water that follows the increased sodium reabsorption is responsible for the increased blood volume and blood pressure. The lack of suppression of renin secretion by the increased blood pressure is thought to be responsible for the low levels of potassium in the blood. The increased sodium reabsorption also increases the excretion of hydrogen ions in the urine, producing metabolic alkalosis. The JAK/STAT pathway is activated by the binding of growth hormone to its receptor. Intracellular receptors include the steroid receptors and the receptors for thyroid hormones, retinoic acid, and vitamin D. The cAMP and cGMP pathways are intracellular second messenger systems.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
