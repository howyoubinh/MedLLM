    "question": "A 22-year-old man with sickle cell disease is brought to the emergency room for acute onset facial asymmetry and severe pain. He was in school when his teacher noted a drooping of his left face. His temperature is 99.9°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 122/89 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for facial asymmetry and 4/5 strength in the patient's upper and lower extremity. A CT scan of the head does not demonstrate an intracranial bleed. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alteplase",
      "B": "Exchange transfusion",
      "C": "Heparin",
      "D": "Warfarin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a sickle cell disease exacerbation with an acute ischemic stroke. The treatment of choice is an exchange transfusion. Alteplase is used for acute ischemic stroke in patients with normal platelet count and no history of intracranial hemorrhage. Heparin is used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism. Warfarin is used for long-term anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
