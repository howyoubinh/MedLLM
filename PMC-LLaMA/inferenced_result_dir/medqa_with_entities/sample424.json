    "question": "A 45-year-old Caucasian male presents to a gastroenterologist complaining of heartburn and difficulty swallowing. He recalls that he has been told by his primary care physician that he suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The gastroenterologist decides to perform an upper endoscopy with biopsy. Which of the following findings would be consistent with Barrett's esophagus?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Presence of Paneth cells in the lower esophagus",
      "B": "Metaplasia in the upper esophagus",
      "C": "A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus",
      "D": "Esophageal varices"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of columnar epithelium in the esophagus is a metaplastic change secondary to GERD. The presence of Paneth cells in the lower esophagus would be incorrect because Paneth cells are normally found in the basal poion of the small intestine. The other choices are not associated with Barrett's esophagus.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
