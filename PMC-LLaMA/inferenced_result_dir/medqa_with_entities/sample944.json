    "question": "Two days after admission to the hospital for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, a 35-year-old man develops nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps. He has a history of diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and reports occasionally using marijuana. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.1°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show:\nLeukocyte count 16,000/mm3\nHemoglobin 13.4 g/dL\nPlatelet count 180,000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 134 mEq/L\nK+ 5.9 mEq/L\nCl- 101 mEq/L\nHCO3- 24 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen 27 mg/dL\nUric acid 11.2 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2.2 mg/dL\nGlucose 134 mg/dL\nCa2+ 6.8 mg/dL\nMg2+ 1.8 g/dL\nPhosphorus 8.9 mg/dL\nWhich of the following would have been most effective in preventing this patient's current symptoms?\"",

  "model_response": "This patient has tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) as a result of treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia. TLS is characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and acute renal failure. It is most commonly seen during the treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and other rapidly proliferating lymphomas. TLS is caused by the destruction of a large number of rapidly proliferating neoplastic cells, which leads to release of intracellular ions and metabolic byproducts into the systemic circulation. The most effective way to prevent TLS is to alkalinize the urine to a pH of 7.0 or greater using sodium bicarbonate. Allopurinol is a uric acid synthesis inhibitor that should be used with caution in patients with compromised renal function because it may lead to a sudden increase in serum uric acid levels, which can precipitate in the renal tubules and cause renal failure. Rasburicase can be used to reduce high levels of uric acid in patients with TLS, but urine alkalinization is the treatment of choice. TLS usually develops within 12-48 hours after initiation of chemotherapy. TLS is more common in patients with a large tumor burden, a high proliferation rate, and a high-lactate dehydrogenase level. TLS resolves spontaneously if the patient survives and the leukemia is successfully treated.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
