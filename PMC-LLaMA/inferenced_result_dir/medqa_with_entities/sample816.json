    "question": "A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine bone mineral density screening. She does not have any children. Menopause was at age 55. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 48 years. She has hypertension for which she takes ramipril. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck shows a T-score of -2.7 SD. The physician considers treatment with raloxifene. This medication would put her at increased risk of developing which of the following conditions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Pulmonary embolism",
      "B": "Cellulitis",
      "C": "Breast cancer",
      "D": "Hypercholesterolemia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient should not receive raloxifene. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is used to prevent and treat osteoporosis. It is also used to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It lowers serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels. The other choices are not complications of raloxifene therapy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
