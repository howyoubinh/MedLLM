    "question": "A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police. He was found at a local celebration acting very strangely and was reported by other patrons of the event. The patient is very anxious and initially is hesitant to answer questions. He denies any substance use and states that he was just trying to have a good time. The patient's responses are slightly delayed and he seems to have difficulty processing his thoughts. The patient tells you he feels very anxious and asks for some medication to calm him down. The patient has a past medical history of psoriasis which is treated with topical steroids. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, you note an anxious young man. HEENT exam reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in his upper and lower extremities. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia, and pulmonary exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely intoxication in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alcohol",
      "B": "Marijuana",
      "C": "Cocaine",
      "D": "Phencyclidine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with intoxication from a dissociative anesthetic agent, such as phencyclidine (PCP). PCP is easily synthesized from N-methyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine, a precursor that is present in many commercial deicing agents. PCP is commonly used as an animal anesthetic and was used in humans until its adverse effects, including disturbances in mental status, motor coordination, and vital signs, became apparent. PCP is often used illicitly for its hallucinogenic properties. It can be ingested, smoked, or insufflated. The complications of PCP use include accidental injuries due to the impaired mental status and disturbances in motor function, as well as the acute intoxication effects of the drug itself. PCP intoxication can be associated with hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis. The duration of action is typically 6-24 hours after ingestion. The diagnosis of PCP intoxication is based on the clinical presentation and history of drug use. Laboratory studies may be helpful in evaluating for other substances of abuse, but specific PCP tests are not routinely available. Treatment of PCP intoxication is largely supportive, including close monitoring of vital signs and provision of hydration. Sedatives may be used to control agitation. In severe cases, when the patient's mental status and motor function are significantly impaired, intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
