    "question": "A 24-year-old Asian woman is admitted to the hospital at 30 weeks gestation with nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain. She is gravida 2 para 0 with a history of the same complaints in her last pregnancy which ended with a stillbirth at the 31st week. Her older sister had preeclampsia in both of her pregnancies. Currently, the patient is responsive but lethargic. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 85/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and temperature 36.4°C (97.5°F). The physical examination shows jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. The patient’s laboratory findings are as follows:\nErythrocyte count 2.7 million/mm3\nHemoglobin 10.1 g/dL\nHematocrit 0.56\nReticulocyte count 1.1%\nLeukocyte count 8,300/mm3\nThrombocyte count 190,000/mm3\nTotal bilirubin 5.3 mg/dL (91 µmol/L)\nConjugated bilirubin 4.2 mg/dL (72 µmol/L)\nAlanine Transaminase (ALT) 101 U/L\nAspartate Transaminase (AST) 99 U/L\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL (80 µmol/L)\nWhich of the following factors is a risk factor for this patient’s condition?",

  "model_response": "The patient’s age is not a risk factor for this condition.\nNulliparity is a risk factor for this condition.\nHistory in the previous pregnancy is a risk factor for this condition.\nHistory of preeclampsia in a sibling is a risk factor for this condition.\n\nThe patient’s presentation is consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP). The patient’s age, nulliparity, family history of preeclampsia, and previous stillbirth are all risk factors for AFLP. The patient’s laboratory findings are consistent with AFLP. The liver enzymes are only mildly elevated, but the serum bilirubin is significantly elevated. The liver biopsy is characterized by microvesicular fatty infiltration. The treatment is delivery of the fetus and supportive therapy.\n\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Obstetric Neuropathy. ACOG Committee Opinion No. 299.
