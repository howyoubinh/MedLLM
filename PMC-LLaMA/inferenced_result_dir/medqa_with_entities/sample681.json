    "question": "A 29-year-old female presents to her primary care provider with an aching pain in her left leg that has progressively gotten worse over several days. She recently had an unfortunate sporting incident resulting in large bruises along both legs and lower thighs. An X-ray after the event was negative for fracture. Past medical history is positive for systemic lupus erythematosus. She also has a history of one spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 119/80 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, her left leg appears pink and slightly swollen. Homan’s sign is positive. A Doppler ultrasound reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. Her lab results are as follows:\nPlatelets 250,000/mm3\nProthrombin Time 14 sec\nPartial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec\nMixing study (PTT) 89 sec\nWhat is the most likely cause of the patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa",
      "B": "Antibodies directed against phospholipids",
      "C": "Antibodies directed against endothelial cells",
      "D": "Vitamin K deficiency"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s laboratory results are consistent with a hypercoagulable state. The mixing study is prolonged, suggesting a coagulation factor deficiency. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, which is associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. This syndrome is associated with antibodies directed against phospholipids. These antibodies can cause thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thrombosis. The antibodies can also cause miscarriages. The treatment for deep venous thrombosis in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome is heparin.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
