    "question": "A 38-year-old woman is being evaluated by her primary care physician for chronic, widespread pain that started around 5 months ago. This pain has been accompanied by sleeping issues. Her friend recommended that she try yoga to relieve the pain, but she says this has not helped her at all. Se says the symptoms have begun to impact her daily functions and keep her from doing things she used to enjoy. Past medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder, for which she currently takes no medication. The patient had been previously medicated with paroxetine for 5 years. On physical examination, several areas of point tenderness are found on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. Laboratory work up is unremarkable. What is the best treatment option for the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Low-dose prednisolone",
      "B": "High-dose prednisolone",
      "C": "Paroxetine",

  "model_response": "The patient's chronic pain, sleep disturbance, and prior history of generalized anxiety disorder are suggestive of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome of chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with tenderness in 11 of 18 specific points. It is frequently associated with other symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbance, headaches, anxiety, and irritable bowel syndrome. Fibromyalgia is more common in individuals with a history of anxiety disorders and depression. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is based on clinical criteria that include pain in the absence of other disease or injury and tenderness in 11 of 18 specific points. The pain must be present for at least 3 months. The points include the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. The most effective treatments for fibromyalgia are aerobic exercise and medications that enhance serotonin and norepinephrine availability. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine, are the most effective medications for fibromyalgia. However, because of the patient's history of generalized anxiety disorder, a medication with less sedation and anticholinergic side effects, such as duloxetine, would be a better choice. Other medications that may be effective include monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as moclobemide, and muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine.\n\n### EDITOR'S NOTE: Duloxetine is not currently available in the United States for the treatment of fibromyalgia.\n\n### EDITOR'S NOTE: The correct answer is D (Allopurinol). The presence of point tenderness at specific points (11 of 18 specific points) in a patient with chronic widespread pain and sleep disturbance is highly suggestive of fibromyalgia. The patient's history of generalized anxiety disorder treated with paroxetine is significant because tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine) are the most effective pharmacologic treatments for fibromyalgia. However, the patient's history of generalized anxiety disorder treated with paroxetine is significant because tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine) are the most effective pharmacologic treatments for fibromyalgia. The presence of point tenderness at specific points (11 of 18 specific points) in a patient with chronic widespread pain and sleep disturbance is highly suggestive of fibromyalgia. The most common cause of secondary fibromyalgia is rheumatic disease. In this patient, the absence of joint swelling, fatigue, and other systemic symptoms makes the diagnosis of rheumatic disease unlikely. The most common cause of secondary fibromyalgia is rheumatic disease. In this patient, the absence of joint swelling, fatigue, and other systemic symptoms makes the diagnosis of rheumatic disease unlikely. The next most common cause of secondary fibromyalgia is hypothyroidism. However, the patient's TSH level is within normal limits. Other potential causes of secondary fibromyalgia include infectious diseases (hepatitis C, Lyme disease, and human immunodeficiency virus), malignancy, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient's history of physical abuse as a child is significant because it may be related to the development of fibromyalgia. The most common cause of secondary fibromyalgia is rheumatic disease.
