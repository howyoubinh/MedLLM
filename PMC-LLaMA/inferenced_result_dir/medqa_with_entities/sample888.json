    "question": "An academic obstetrician is conducting a retrospective cohort study that evaluates the risk of placenta accreta at all statewide medical centers. Per chart review he finds that a prior cesarian birth is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta. The relative risk associated with this finding is 1.23. The associated p-value is 0.03. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The 99% confidence interval includes the null hypothesis.",
      "B": "The chance of bias in favor of the alternative hypothesis is 3%.",
      "C": "The p-value represents the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta in women with prior cesarian birth, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true.",
      "D": "The p-value represents the likelihood that the alternative hypothesis is false."
