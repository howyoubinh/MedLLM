    "question": "A 39-year-old woman presents to the clinic for her annual physical. Although she feels generally healthy she has noticed gaining about 9 kg (20 lb) over the last year. She eats a healthy, varied diet and exercises at the gym 4 days a week, including 20 minutes of aerobic exercise. On further questioning, she has also noted fatigue and constipation. She denies shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or blood in her stool. At the clinic, the vital signs include: pulse 52/min, blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable only for slightly dry skin. The complete blood count (CBC) is within normal limits. Which of the following laboratory values is most likely elevated in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Glucose",
      "B": "Triiodothyronine (T3)",
      "C": "Thyroxine (T4)",
      "D": "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's weight gain, fatigue, and constipation are all consistent with hypothyroidism. The normal CBC excludes anemia as a contributing factor. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in non-pregnant adults is autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland. This patient's normal CBC and the absence of other clinical findings make other causes of hypothyroidism less likely. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in adults is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The initial screening test of choice is a serum TSH. An elevated TSH (>5 mIU/L) confirms the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. The other listed choices are not likely to be elevated in this patient.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
