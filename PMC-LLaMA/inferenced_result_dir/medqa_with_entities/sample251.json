    "question": "A 71-year-old man complains of urinary hesitancy and nocturia of increasing frequency over the past several months. Digital rectal exam was positive for a slightly enlarged prostate but did not detect any additional abnormalities of the prostate or rectum. The patient’s serum PSA was measured to be 6 ng/mL. Image A shows a transabdominal ultrasound of the patient. Which of the following medications should be included to optimally treat the patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Clonidine",
      "B": "Finasteride",
      "C": "Dihydrotestosterone",
      "D": "Furosemide"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The combination of symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. The transabdominal ultrasound shows a homogeneous, enlarged prostate. The PSA is within normal limits for this age group. Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that can be used to treat hypertension. It has no role in the treatment of BPH. Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is the major androgen responsible for the growth of the prostate. Finasteride has been shown to reduce the size of the prostate and improve urinary symptoms in men with BPH. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that is used to treat hypertension and edema. It has no role in the treatment of BPH.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
