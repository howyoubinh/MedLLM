    "question": "A 14-year-old obese boy presents with severe right hip and knee pain. The patient says that he has been limping with mild pain for the past three weeks, but the pain acutely worsened today. He describes the pain as severe, non-radiating, sharp and aching in character, and localized to the right hip and knee joints. The patient denies recent illness, travel, trauma, or similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history and no current medications. The patient is not sexually active and denies any alcohol, smoking or drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The right leg is externally rotated, and there is a limited range of motion in the right hip. Strength is 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint and 5 out of 5 elsewhere. There is no tenderness to palpation. No joint erythema, edema or effusion present. Sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Reassess in 3 months",
      "B": "Intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the right hip joint",
      "C": "Pavlik harness",
      "D": "Surgical pinning of the right hip"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The most appropriate treatment is surgical pinning of the right hip. SCFE is the displacement of the femoral head off the femoral neck through the physeal plate. It is most common in obese boys aged 10-16 years. The displacement is usually posterior and inferior. Symptoms include hip or knee pain, often accompanied by a limp. The physical examination shows limited range of motion and may show hip external rotation. The diagnosis is confirmed by plain radiographs. Treatment is surgical, and the most common procedure is posterior hip pinning.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
