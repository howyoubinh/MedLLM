It arises from neural crest tissue of the sympathetic nervous system, from the orbit to the pelvis. The tumor is composed of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Foci of mature ganglion cells are present in 50% of tumors, and these areas are more likely to be found in the less-differentiated tumors. Foci of glial cells are also found in many tumors, and the presence of rosettes, best seen with silver stains, is a feature of the Ewing tumor. Neuroblastoma is a disease of early childhood, with 90% of patients presenting before 5 years of age. The most common sites of metastases are bone, bone marrow, liver, and subcutaneous tissue. The prognosis is related to the age of the patient at diagnosis, the stage of the disease, and the degree of differentiation of the tumor. The most useful prognostic marker is the amplification of the MYCN (N-myc) gene found on chromosome 2. The more neuroblasts present in the tumor, the more likely it is to metastasize and the worse the prognosis for the patient.

The most common sites of metastases are bone, bone marrow, liver, and subcutaneous tissue. The prognosis is related to the age of the patient at diagnosis, the stage of the disease, and the degree of differentiation of the tumor. The most useful prognostic marker is the amplification of the MYCN (N-myc) gene found on chromosome 2. The more neuroblasts present in the tumor, the more likely it is to metastasize and the worse the prognosis for the patient.\n\n###PATHOLOGIC FEATURES\n\nGrossly, neuroblastomas are soft, friable, gray-white tumors that often contain calcifications and areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. On microscopic examination, the tumors are composed of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Foci of mature ganglion cells are present in 50% of tumors, and these areas are more likely to be found in the less-differentiated tumors. Foci of glial cells are also found in many tumors.
