    "question": "A 22-year-old male presents to the emergency room complaining of neck stiffness. He reports that his neck started “locking” three hours ago. He is now unable to move it. His past medical history is notable for schizophrenia and asthma and he currently takes albuterol as well as another medication whose name he does not remember. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. He speaks in full sentences and is oriented to person, place, and time. The patient’s neck is flexed and rotated to the right approximately 40 degrees. The right sternocleidomastoid and trapezius are firm and contracted. Extraocular movements are full and intact. Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices. Which of the following should most likely be administered to this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Glycopyrrolate",
      "B": "Benztropine",
      "C": "Levodopa",
      "D": "Dantrolene"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are consistent with acute muscular dystonia induced by his antipsychotic medication. Glycopyrrolate is a muscarinic antagonist that can be used to help reverse the symptoms of acute muscular dystonia. Benztropine is also used to treat acute muscular dystonia and is more effective than diphenhydramine in treating this condition. Levodopa is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Dantrolene is a skeletal muscle relaxant that is used to treat spasticity and muscle rigidity.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
