    "question": "A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of excessive fatigue and weakness for the last several weeks. He also complains of abdominal pain and constipation for the same duration. On further questioning, he reports that he has lost 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks. Past medical history and family history are insignificant. His temperature is 37.3° C (99.2° F), respirations are 21/min, pulse is 63/min, and blood pressure is 99/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, he is a tired-appearing, thin male. He has a bronze discoloration to his skin, but he denies being outside in the sun or any history of laying in tanning beds. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer intravenous fludrocortisone",
      "B": "Start him on androgen replacement treatment",
      "C": "Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy",
      "D": "Order an ACTH stimulation test"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with adrenal insufficiency. The next best step in the management of this patient is to start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy. Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid that will help correct the patient's hypoglycemia and fluid shift, and fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that will help correct the patient's volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities. An ACTH stimulation test is used to determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency, but this patient should be started on replacement therapy before the results of the ACTH stimulation test are available. Androgen replacement therapy is not indicated in this patient because he is not hypogonadal. Intravenous fludrocortisone is not indicated because the mineralocorticoid deficiency is likely part of the adrenal insufficiency.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
