She received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis in the emergency department and has already received 2 doses of the rabies vaccine. The same physician has been managing the post-exposure care regimen. After the physician administers the third dose of the rabies vaccine, the patient asks him if he would like to join her for a movie and dinner. The physician is interested in going on a date with her. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.",
      "B": "Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because her case is uncomplicated and does not require decision-making on his part.",
      "C": "Inform the patient that dating her will never be appropriate even once the physician-patient relationship has been terminated.",
      "D": "Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her, but that she will have to transfer her care to a different physician."
