    "question": "A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours. She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Misoprostol therapy",
      "B": "Methotrexate therapy",
      "C": "Dilation and curettage",
      "D": "Complete bed rest"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a threatened abortion, as she has vaginal bleeding and a closed cervical os. She has a uterus consistent with her stated gestation, but no fetus is evident by ultrasonography. The appropriate next step in management is bed rest. Bed rest has not been proven to change the outcome of pregnancy, but it may reduce stress on the pelvic vessels and may prevent a fall. In addition, it allows for easy detection of recurrent bleeding or pain. Dilation and curettage is not indicated in the absence of a fetus or an open cervical os. Methotrexate therapy is not indicated because there is no evidence of a multifetal gestation. Misoprostol therapy is not indicated because there is no evidence of an open cervical os.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
