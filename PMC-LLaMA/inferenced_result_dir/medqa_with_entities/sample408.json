    "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the physician after elevated liver function tests were found after a routine screening. He has had occasional headaches over the past year, but otherwise feels well. The patient reports that he was involved in a severe car accident 30 years ago. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He has never used illicit intravenous drugs. He takes no medications and has no known allergies. His father had a history of alcoholism and died of liver cancer. The patient appears thin. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 10,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 146,000/mm3\nSerum\nGlucose 150 mg/dL\nAlbumin 3.2 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 75 U/L\nAST 95 U/L\nALT 73 U/L\nHIV negative\nHepatitis B surface antigen negative\nHepatitis C antibody positive\nHCV RNA positive\nHCV genotype 1\nA liver biopsy is performed and shows mononuclear infiltrates that are limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\"",
