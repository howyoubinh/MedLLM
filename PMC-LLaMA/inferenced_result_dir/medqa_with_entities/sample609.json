    "question": "A 34-year-old woman with poorly controlled Crohn disease comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of hair loss and a rash on her face. She has also noticed that food has recently tasted bland to her. She had to undergo segmental small bowel resection several times because of intestinal obstruction and fistula formation. Examination shows several bullous, erythematous perioral plaques. There are two well-circumscribed circular patches of hair loss on the scalp. A deficiency of which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Niacin",
      "B": "Cobalamin",
      "C": "Iron",
      "D": "Zinc"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has acquired zinc deficiency, which can occur in malabsorption states and other conditions. Zinc is a cofactor for carbonic anhydrase, alkaline phosphatase, and carboxypeptidase, and it is a component of many transcription factors. Zinc deficiency causes a characteristic rash, hair loss, and impaired wound healing. Niacin deficiency can cause a similar skin rash, but the distribution is typically the sun-exposed areas of the body. Cobalamin deficiency can cause a variety of neurologic symptoms, but not the skin findings seen in this patient. Iron deficiency can cause a hypochromic, microcytic anemia, but does not affect the skin.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
