    "question": "A 46-year-old man presents with worsening pain in multiple joints for the past 2 weeks. He says the pain is most severe in the proximal parts of his fingers and his wrists, but it has now spread to his elbows, and, occasionally, his knees. He says the joint involvement is symmetric. He also complains of morning joint stiffness that improves with activity and reports feeling fatigued during the day. He started taking ibuprofen 2 months ago for the pain which initially subsided, but, over the last few weeks, it has worsened despite the medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago and has had difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a weight loss of 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the last 3 months despite no change in diet or activity level. Which of the following is the most likely 1st-line medication in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Infliximab",
      "B": "Anakinra",
      "C": "Methotrexate",
      "D": "High-dose prednisone for 60 days"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The initial treatment of choice for most patients with RA is a non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as methotrexate. Methotrexate has been shown to reduce joint damage and slow disease progression. It is usually given in combination with a folic acid supplement. Other 1st-line therapies for RA include biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (e.g., infliximab). Anakinra, an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, is also a 1st-line therapy for RA, but is less commonly used due to its marginal efficacy compared to other options. High-dose prednisone for 60 days is not a recommended initial therapy for RA.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
