    "question": "An investigator is studying the growth pattern of a particular bacterial strain that caused a respiratory disease outbreak in children in rural Venezuela. The bacteria are found to be able to grow in a specialized culture that contains sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite; the colonies are black and have a shining surface. The isolated bacteria are most likely which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Legionella pneumophila",
      "B": "Haemophilus influenzae",
      "C": "Bordetella pertussis",
      "D": "Corynebacterium diphtheriae"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The organism is Legionella pneumophila, which is a fastidious organism that has been isolated from cooling towers and from the respiratory tract of patients with a severe pneumonia. The organism requires a special culture medium that contains cysteine, antibiotics, and charcoal. The medium is buffered with phosphates and supplemented with iron and the vitamins pyridoxine and riboflavin. The colonies are black and have a shining surface.\n\nHaemophilus influenzae grows on blood agar but does not require blood for growth. It does not produce colonies with a shiny surface.\n\nBordetella pertussis grows on blood agar but does not require blood for growth. It does not produce colonies with a shiny surface.\n\nCorynebacterium diphtheriae grows on blood agar but does not require blood for growth. It does not produce colonies with a shiny surface.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
