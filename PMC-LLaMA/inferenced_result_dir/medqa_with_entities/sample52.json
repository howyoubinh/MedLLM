    "question": "A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his skin and generalized pruritus. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus. Urinalysis shows an elevated concentration of bilirubin and a low concentration of urobilinogen. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity",
      "B": "Increased hemoglobin breakdown",
      "C": "Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption",
      "D": "Defective hepatic bile excretion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity would lead to the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood and tissues, resulting in jaundice. Increased hemoglobin breakdown, as in hemolytic anemias, would lead to an increase in unconjugated bilirubin in the blood and tissues, resulting in jaundice. Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption would lead to an increase in conjugated bilirubin in the blood and tissues, resulting in jaundice. Defective hepatic bile excretion, as in biliary obstruction, would lead to an increase in conjugated bilirubin in the blood and tissues, resulting in jaundice.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
