    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because a 5-week history of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea that has worsened in the past 24 hours. She was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 1 year ago but has had difficulty complying with her drug regimen. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 92/56 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended, rigid abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds. Fluid resuscitation is initiated. In addition to complete bowel rest, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Abdominal CT scan with contrast",
      "B": "CT angiography",
      "C": "Abdominal x-ray",
      "D": "Colonoscopy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with toxic megacolon, a complication of ulcerative colitis that is often precipitated by electrolyte abnormalities and medication noncompliance. The most important initial step in management is fluid resuscitation. The patient should be placed on bowel rest and nasogastric decompression. If the patient does not respond to bowel rest and fluid resuscitation, colectomy should be performed. An abdominal CT scan with contrast would be the most appropriate next step in management to assess for toxic megacolon and the need for emergent surgical intervention.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
