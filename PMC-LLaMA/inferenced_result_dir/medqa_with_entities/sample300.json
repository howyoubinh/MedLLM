    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock",
      "B": "Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock",
      "C": "Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock",
      "D": "Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has developed a right L5 nerve root lesion with resultant right-sided sciatic nerve involvement. This is a rare complication of vaccination, which occurs when the vaccine is injected into the wrong location. The vaccine is injected into the muscle, and the correct location is the inferolateral quadrant of the gluteal muscle. The other incorrect locations are either too superficial or too medial.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
