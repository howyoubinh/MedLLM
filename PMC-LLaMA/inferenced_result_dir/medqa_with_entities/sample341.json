    "question": "A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. On examination, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated. After 5 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate to 90/min. A decision to perform an episiotomy is made to expedite vaginal delivery. The anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies which of the following structures?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Skin of the lateral thigh",
      "B": "External anal sphincter",
      "C": "Skin of the mons pubis",
      "D": "Detrusor muscle"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The anesthetized nerve is the pudendal nerve, which supplies the external anal sphincter, the skin of the perineum and vulva, and the skin of the medial thigh. The detrusor muscle is supplied by the pelvic splanchnic nerves. The skin of the mons pubis and labia majora is supplied by the anterior cutaneous branches of the ilioinguinal nerve. The skin of the medial thigh is supplied by the anterior cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
