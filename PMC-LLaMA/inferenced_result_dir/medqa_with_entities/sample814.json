    "question": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He is growing along with the 75th percentile and meeting all milestones. Physical examination shows a poorly rugated scrotum. The palpation of the scrotum shows only 1 testicle. A 2nd testicle is palpated in the inguinal canal. The examination of the penis shows a normal urethral meatus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chorionic gonadotropin therapy",
      "B": "Exploratory laparoscopy",
      "C": "Orchiectomy",
      "D": "Orchiopexy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This is a case of an undescended testis. The first step in the management of this condition is to determine the location of the testis. An examination by a pediatric surgeon is indicated. If the testis is palpated in the inguinal canal, then orchidopexy is indicated. If the testis is not palpable, then chorionic gonadotropin therapy is indicated. If the testis is not located in the inguinal canal or the testis is atrophic, then orchiectomy is indicated.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
