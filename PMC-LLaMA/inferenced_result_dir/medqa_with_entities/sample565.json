    "question": "A 63-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. During this period, the patient has had recurrent episodes of high-grade fever, night sweats, and feelings of fatigue. Two months ago, he had herpes zoster that was treated with acyclovir. He appears pale. Temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized painless lymphadenopathy. The liver and the spleen are palpated 2–3 cm below the right and the left costal margin, respectively. Laboratory studies show:\nHematocrit 42%\nLeukocyte count 15,000/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 46%\nEosinophils 1%\nLymphocytes 50%\nMonocytes 3%\nPlatelet count 120,000/mm3\nBlood smear shows mature lymphocytes that rupture easily and appear as artifacts on a blood smear. Flow cytometry shows lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?\"",

The treatment of CLL is controversial. Some clinicians prefer to observe the patient and monitor disease progression, while others treat the disease aggressively. The treatment of SLL is similar to that of small lymphocytic lymphoma. The treatment of choice is fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. The other choices are not appropriate treatments for CLL.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
