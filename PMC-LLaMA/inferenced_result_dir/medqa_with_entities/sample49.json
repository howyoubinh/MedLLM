    "question": "A 67-year-old man is hospitalized after several days of fever and increasing shortness of breath. Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir. Despite therapy, his shortness of breath continues to worsen and his oxygen saturation decreases to the point where ICU transfer and intubation are required. Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After several weeks of supportive therapy, the patient improves with lung function returning to near normal. Which of the following processes is involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells",
      "B": "Excess mucus production by goblet cells",
      "C": "Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells",
      "D": "Proliferation of club cells"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The normal alveolar lining contains type I and II pneumocytes, which are responsible for gas exchange, and club cells, which secrete surfactant. In ARDS, there is damage to alveoli, and the normal alveolar lining is replaced by a layer of fibrous tissue. With resolution of the alveolar damage and resulting in regeneration of the alveolar lining, type I and II pneumocytes will replicate to replenish the alveolar lining. Club cells will not replicate, but will undergo hyperplasia in response to the damage. Ciliated cells will also undergo hyperplasia in response to the damage. Goblet cells are not involved in the regeneration of the alveolar lining, but will undergo hyperplasia in response to the damage.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
