    "question": "A 45-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician after an episode of hemoptysis. Over the past 8 months, she has had a nonproductive cough, fatigue, and a 9-kg (20-lb) weight loss. She drinks a glass of wine every night and does not smoke. She has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. She does not take any medications. She has never traveled out of the country. She works as an accountant. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An x-ray of the chest shows a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the left lung with no mediastinal or hilar enlargement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Carcinoid tumor",
      "B": "Sarcoidosis",
      "C": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung",
      "D": "Adenocarcinoma of the lung"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of a lung cancer. The most common lung cancer in a lifetime non-smoker is adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is more commonly seen in women and nonsmokers. It is more commonly peripherally located and tends to be more slow growing. The radiographic characteristics of adenocarcinoma include a peripheral location, a predominantly ground-glass appearance, and a lack of mediastinal adenopathy. The other choices are less likely. Carcinoid tumors are most commonly seen in the 40- to 60-year age group and are more commonly peripherally located. They are more likely to be multiple and are not associated with hemoptysis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that is more commonly seen in African Americans. It is associated with uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions. It is not associated with hemoptysis. Squamous cell carcinoma is more commonly seen in smokers and is associated with a history of smoking. It is more commonly centrally located and tends to be more aggressive.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
