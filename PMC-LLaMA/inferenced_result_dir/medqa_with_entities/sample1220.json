    "question": "A 67-year-old woman with depression comes to the physician because of easy bruising and bleeding of her gums for the past 2 months. She has been living alone since the death of her husband 1 year ago. She appears thin and has temporal wasting bilaterally. Physical examination shows bruises on her lower legs, swollen gums, and petechiae on the hard palate. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance that is composed primarily of which of the following amino acids?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Glycine",
      "B": "Proline",
      "C": "Lysine",
      "D": "Arginine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has scurvy, which is caused by a dietary deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is necessary for the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen, and patients with vitamin C deficiency exhibit poor wound healing. The defective collagen causes abnormal blood vessel formation, leading to easy bruising and bleeding. The body's inability to make normal collagen also leads to swollen gums and petechiae. None of the other choices contain proline.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
