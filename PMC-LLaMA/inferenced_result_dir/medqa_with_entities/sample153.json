    "question": "A 71-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine visit. His psychiatric history is significant for major depression with psychotic features. He was diagnosed after his wife died from pancreatic cancer four years earlier. Three years ago, he deliberately overdosed on sleeping pills. Today, he feels well but still wakes up frequently at night and cannot sleep through the night. He lives alone in his apartment and has no children. He does not possess a firearm at home but has access to weapons at a local hunting club. The patient currently denies suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm. He takes sertraline and olanzapine. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient?",

      "definition": "A synthetic derivative of thienobenzodiazepine with antipsychotic, antinausea, and antiemetic activities. As a selective monoaminergic antagonist, olanzapine binds with high affinity binding to the following receptors: serotoninergic, dopaminergic, muscarinic M1-5, histamine H1, and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors; it binds weakly to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A, benzodiazepine, and beta-adrenergic receptors. The antinausea and antiemetic effects of this agent appear to be due to the blockade of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors for serotonin. Although its exact mechanism of action in schizophrenia is unknown, it has been proposed that olanzapine's antipsychotic activity is mediated through antagonism to dopamine D2 receptors with rapid ligand-receptor dissociation kinetics that help to minimize extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Olanzapine may also stimulate appetite."
