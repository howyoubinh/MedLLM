    "question": "A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. Current medications include glyburide and amlodipine. The physician prescribes a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate. Which of the following changes to the serum is most likely to develop as an adverse effect of the prescribed drug?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased creatine kinase concentration",
      "B": "Decreased glucose concentration",
      "C": "Increased triglyceride concentration",
      "D": "Increased bradykinin concentration"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient is most likely receiving a statin, such as lovastatin, which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and decreases the synthesis of mevalonate. Elevated transaminases are common adverse effects. Lovastatin also can interfere with the metabolism of some drugs, including oral contraceptives, clofibrate, and niacin. The most common adverse effect of statins is myopathy, which should be suspected if creatine kinase concentration is elevated. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker and glyburide is a sulfonylurea, so these medications are not likely to be affected by statin therapy. Bradykinin is not affected by statin therapy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
