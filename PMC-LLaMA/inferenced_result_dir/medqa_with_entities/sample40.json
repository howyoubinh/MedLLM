    "question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back. What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypothyroidism",
      "B": "Idiopathic hirsutism",
      "C": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)",
      "D": "Ovarian hyperthecosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis of this patient is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder that affects 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenemia. The clinical features include menstrual irregularities (most often oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea), infertility, hirsutism, obesity, and glucose intolerance. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings. The Rotterdam 2003 criteria require two of the following three to make the diagnosis: oligo/anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. The presence of polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography is not necessary for the diagnosis and is not included in the criteria. This patient has irregular menses, hirsutism, and glucose intolerance. The presence of obesity and acne are less specific for PCOS. The normal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) level suggests that this patient does not have PCOS associated with a pituitary LH-secreting tumor. The elevated serum testosterone level is consistent with PCOS. The normal serum DHEA-S level makes an adrenal source of hyperandrogenism less likely. The normal serum estradiol level makes an ovarian source of hyperandrogenism less likely. The normal serum FSH level makes an ovarian source of hyperandrogenism less likely. The normal serum prolactin and TSH levels are not helpful in making the diagnosis. The most common cause of glucose intolerance in patients with PCOS is insulin resistance. The management of PCOS includes weight loss, oral contraceptive agents, insulin sensitizers, glucose lowering agents, and surgery. Weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and lowers androgen levels. Oral contraceptive agents suppress ovarian androgen production and reduce testosterone, free androgen, and DHEA levels. They also reduce acne and the risk of endometrial cancer. Insulin sensitizers such as metformin reduce insulin resistance, lower plasma glucose and insulin levels, and reduce androgen levels. Glucose lowering agents are not typically used in women with PCOS who are not diabetic. Surgery is typically not used as a first-line treatment for PCOS.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
