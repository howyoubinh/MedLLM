    "question": "A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, at 22 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department for abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding for 2 hours. She has had no prenatal care. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, and regular contractions are felt every 2 minutes. The uterus is consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. There is blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of the thighs. Ultrasound shows complete detachment of the placenta from the uterus. Fetal heart tones are absent. An emergent cesarean delivery is performed. Following the procedure, the patient becomes tearful and distraught. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?",
