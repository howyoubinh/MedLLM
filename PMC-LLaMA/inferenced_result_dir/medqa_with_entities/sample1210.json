    "question": "A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for yellowing of his eyes. The patient has been relatively healthy and just recently started “intermittent fasting” to try to lose weight. He recalls a similar episode 4 years ago when he was recovering from an emergency appendectomy. The patient denies smoking but endorses an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. He is sexually active with both men and women. His physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract",
      "B": "Chronic viral infection of the liver",
      "C": "Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase",
      "D": "Defective bilirubin excretion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is C. This patient's symptoms are consistent with Gilbert's syndrome, which is a common inherited disorder that affects approximately 3-5% of the population. It is caused by a mutation in the UGT1A1 gene, which encodes the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. This enzyme is responsible for conjugating bilirubin in the liver. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome have a decreased activity of this enzyme, which leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The disorder is usually asymptomatic, but fasting, illness, stress, and alcohol can precipitate jaundice. The syndrome is benign and requires no treatment.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
