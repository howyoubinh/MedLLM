    "question": "An otherwise healthy 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss during this time. Physical examination shows bilateral pitting pedal edema. An endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus. Biopsy shows parietal cell atrophy. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Serotonin-secreting gastric tumor",
      "B": "Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells",
      "C": "Excessive somatostatin secretion",
      "D": "Ectopic secretion of gastrin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has achlorhydria, which is associated with pernicious anemia. This is caused by autoimmune destruction of parietal cells and eventual atrophy of gastric glands. The loss of parietal cells reduces the ability of the stomach to secrete acid and intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is required for the absorption of dietary vitamin B12, and a vitamin B12 deficiency develops. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes a megaloblastic anemia that progresses to a demyelinating neuropathy (pernicious anemia). The patient may also have a low serum folate level because of the loss of the pteroyl-glutamic acid side chain of folic acid, which is normally cleaved in the acid environment of the stomach. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia can be confirmed by the Schilling test, which shows no increase in urinary excretion of radioactive vitamin B12 after the oral administration of intrinsic factor. A serotonin-secreting tumor (carcinoid) can cause diarrhea, but it does not cause achlorhydria. Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells (Ménétrier disease) causes an increase in gastric mucosal thickness, but it does not cause achlorhydria. Excessive somatostatin secretion inhibits the release of gastrin and thus reduces acid secretion, but it does not cause achlorhydria. Ectopic secretion of gastrin causes Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is characterized by excessive acid secretion and peptic ulcer disease.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
