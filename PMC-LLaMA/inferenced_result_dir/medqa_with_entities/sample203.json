    "question": "A 39-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because he has been having severe headaches and fever for the last 2 days. He also says his right eyelid has been painlessly swelling and is starting to block his vision from that eye. He recently returned from a tour of the world where he visited Thailand, Ethiopia, and Brazil. Otherwise his past medical history is unremarkable. On presentation, his temperature is 102°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 126/81 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, and respirations are 13/min. Physical exam reveals a nontender swelling of the right eyelid, lymphadenopathy, and an indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg. Which of the following drugs should be used to treat this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Benznidazole",
      "B": "Ivermectin",
      "C": "Mebendazol",

The skin test for this disease is the Montenegro test, which is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. The drug of choice for treating this condition is either benznidazole or stibogluconate. Ivermectin is used to treat onchocerciasis (river blindness). Mebendazole is an antihelminthic used to treat pinworms, roundworms, and whipworms.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
