    "question": "A 13-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with severe knee, hip, and groin pain. The patient has a past medical history notable only for obesity and asthma. His temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 124/65 mmHg, pulse is 128/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an inability of the patient to bear weight on his left leg and limited range of motion of the left hip. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Casting and crutches",
      "B": "Immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness",
      "C": "Supportive therapy and observation",
      "D": "Surgical pinning of the femoral head"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation is most consistent with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The condition is most common in adolescents who are obese and have delayed skeletal maturation. The treatment of choice is surgical pinning of the femoral head to the acetabulum. Close follow-up is necessary to prevent further slipping and to minimize the possibility of avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
