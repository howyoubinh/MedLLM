    "question": "A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. The patient states she has pain in the right side of her abdomen which started yesterday and has been worsening. She has experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea during this time. The patient has a past medical history of constipation which is treated with fiber supplements. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note a young woman who appears to be in pain. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Abdominal exam is notable for right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated. The patient is given morphine. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Abdominal radiograph",
      "B": "ß-hCG",
      "C": "CT scan",
      "D": "Stool occult blood"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with acute appendicitis. The next step in management should be to obtain an abdominal radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. The use of abdominal radiographs has been shown to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The use of abdominal radiographs decreases the rate of negative appendectomy. The use of abdominal radiographs also decreases the time to diagnosis and therefore the length of hospital stay.\n\nOption A: An abdominal radiograph is the next best step in management.\n\nOption B: b-hCG is not indicated in this patient.\n\nOption C: A CT scan is not the next best step in management.\n\nOption D: Stool occult blood testing is not indicated in this patient.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
