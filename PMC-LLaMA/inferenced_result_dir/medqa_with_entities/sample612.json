    "question": "A 33-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with bilateral joint pain. She says that the pain has been slowly worsening over the past 3 days. Otherwise, she complains of fatigue, a subjective fever, and a sunburn on her face which she attributes to gardening. The patient is an immigrant from Spain and works as an office assistant. She is not aware of any chronic medical conditions and takes a multivitamin daily. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 125/64 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased complement levels",
      "B": "Increased anti-centromere antibodies",
      "C": "Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies",
      "D": "Increased anti-topoisomerase antibodies"

  "model_response": "The clinical scenario is suggestive of SLE. The most common autoantibodies seen in SLE are antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Other autoantibodies seen in SLE include anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-Ro (SS-A), anti-La (SS-B), anti-histone, and anti-phospholipid. Complement levels are often decreased in SLE.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
