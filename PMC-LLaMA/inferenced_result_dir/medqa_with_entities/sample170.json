    "question": "A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was found down in the middle of the street. His past medical history is unknown. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 104/64 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 5/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. The patient is being resuscitated in the trauma bay. Which of the following was most likely to be found on exam?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ataxia",
      "B": "Conjunctival injection",
      "C": "Miosis",
      "D": "Nystagmus"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's altered mental status and low oxygen saturation suggest cyanosis. The patient's bradycardia suggests that he is likely taking something to slow his heart rate. The miosis suggests that he is taking a substance that causes constriction of the pupils (such as opioids). The ataxia and nystagmus are consistent with intoxication. The conjunctival injection suggests that he has been taking something for a while.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
