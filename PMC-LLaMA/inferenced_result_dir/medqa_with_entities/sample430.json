    "question": "A 63-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic instability. Several days prior, he had been swimming in the Gulf coast when he stepped on a sharp rock and cut his right foot. Three days ago, the patient presented to the emergency room after noticing painful redness spreading along his skin up from his right foot and was subsequently admitted for antibiotic treatment. Currently, his temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 84/46 mmHg with a mean arterial pressure of 59 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 14/min. His telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. His blood cultures are pending, but Gram stain demonstrated gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following best describes the form of shock and the skin exam?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Distributive shock with warm skin",
      "B": "Hypovolemic shock with warm skin",
      "C": "Neurogenic shock with cold skin",
      "D": "Obstructive shock with cold skin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with septic shock, which is a form of distributive shock. The skin findings are consistent with warm shock, which is characterized by vasodilation. The patient's hypotension is due to loss of systemic vascular resistance. The patient's fever is due to the release of endotoxins from the bacteria.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
