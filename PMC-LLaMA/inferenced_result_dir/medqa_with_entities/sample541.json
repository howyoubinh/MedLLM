    "question": "In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9â€“9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?",

      "A": "The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.",
      "B": "The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.",
