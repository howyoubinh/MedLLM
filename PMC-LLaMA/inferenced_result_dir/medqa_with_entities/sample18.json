    "question": "A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to central chest pain over the past 3 days which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Indomethacin +/- omeprazole",
      "B": "Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole",
      "C": "Pericardiocentesis",
      "D": "Pericardiectomy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ECG shows sinus rhythm at 60/min with a normal QRS axis and voltage. There is a 1-mm ST segment elevation in the anterior leads V2-V5 with a concave upward shape. The PR segment is notched in the precordial leads. The differential diagnosis of chest pain and ECG changes includes angina, pericarditis, and Prinzmetal's angina. In this case, the scratching sound suggests pericarditis. The pain characteristics and the ECG changes are consistent with pericarditis. The presence of a friction rub suggests an inflammatory process. The pain is not typical of angina, and the ECG changes are not consistent with Prinzmetal's angina. Pericarditis is more common in men than in women. The most common causes of pericarditis are idiopathic, but also can be caused by infection (including tuberculosis), metabolic diseases, neoplasms, trauma, and collagen vascular diseases. The most common viral cause is Coxsackievirus. The most common bacterial cause is Streptococcus. The most common ECG changes in pericarditis are ST segment elevation, which can have a concave upward shape as seen in this case. PR segment depression can also be seen. The treatment of pericarditis is anti-inflammatory, and the drug of choice is indomethacin. Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used, including ibuprofen and aspirin. Colchicine can be added if there is doubt about the diagnosis or if the patient does not respond to NSAIDs. Omeprazole is used to reduce gastrointestinal damage from NSAIDs. Pericardiocentesis is indicated if there is tamponade, but it is not the optimal therapy for this patient. Pericardiectomy is indicated if there is recurrent pericarditis or constrictive pericarditis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
