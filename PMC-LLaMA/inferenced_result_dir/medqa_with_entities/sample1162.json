    "question": "A 51-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain. Which of the following routes describes the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - right bronchomediastinal trunk - right lymphatic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation",
      "B": "Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation",
      "C": "Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - right bronchomediastinal trunk - right lymphatic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation",
      "D": "Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The sentinel node for the ovary is located in the right lumbar region. From there, lymph is carried through the right lumbar trunk to the cisterna chyli, which then connects to the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct carries lymph to the left subclavian vein, which then enters the systemic circulation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
