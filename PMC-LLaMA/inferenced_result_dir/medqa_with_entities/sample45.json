    "question": "A man is brought into the emergency department by the police department. The officer state that the man has been arrested multiple times for public alcohol intoxication, but recently became homeless. On exam, the man is behaving erratically. His vitals are all within normal limits. He appears confused and has a slurred speech. On gait exam, the patient is ataxic and cannot stand without support for more than a few seconds. Labs return with the following values: Na 140, K 4, Cl 106, BUN 8, Cr 2. His ABG has pH 7.3, PaCO2 13mm, PaO2 130mm, HCO3 7. His urinalysis is shown in Figure 1. Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ethanol",
      "B": "Naltrexone",
      "C": "Naloxone",
      "D": "Fomepizole"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with severe ethylene glycol intoxication. The urine sample shows a high RBC count, which is consistent with acute tubular necrosis due to ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycoaldehyde, which is then metabolized to glycolic acid. This causes severe metabolic acidosis. The treatment for this condition is ethanol or fomepizole. Fomepizole is the preferred agent because it has fewer side effects. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist. Naloxone is a narcotic antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose. Nalmefene is another opioid antagonist.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
