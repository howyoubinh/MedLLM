    "question": "A 58-year-old African American man presents for his yearly wellness visit. He says he has been unsuccessful at losing weight and would like help. His last colonoscopy was 8 years previously, which was normal. Past medical history is significant for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension. Current medications are isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine and aspirin 81 mg orally daily. He is also on CPAP to manage his OSA. The patient denies any history of smoking or recreational drug use and drinks 1 or 2 beers on weekends. Family history is significant for prostate cancer in his father and hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 in his mother. His vital signs include: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable. Fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/dL. Which of the following preventative screening tests would be most appropriate for this patient at this time?",
    "options": {
      "A": "PSA",
      "B": "Digital rectal exam",
      "C": "Abdominal ultrasound",
      "D": "Flexible sigmoidoscopy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men age 55 to 69 years have a digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test done annually. If the DRE is abnormal, a prostate biopsy is recommended. The ACS no longer recommends routine screening of men younger than 55 years or older than 69 years. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine PSA testing in men younger than 70 years. The USPSTF also recommends against routine screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older. The USPSTF does, however, recommend that men 55 to 69 years have a discussion with their doctor about the ris and benefits of PSA testing. An abdominal ultrasound would be appropriate for screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in men 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. A flexible sigmoidoscopy would be appropriate for screening for colorectal cancer in men 50 to 69 years.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
