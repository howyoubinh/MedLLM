    "question": "A 48-year-old woman with chronic tension headaches comes to the physician because of several episodes of bilateral flank pain and reddish urine within the past month. Current medications include aspirin, which she takes almost daily for headaches. Her temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F) and her blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows costovertebral tenderness to percussion bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.2 g/dL and serum creatinine concentration of 2.4 mg/dL. Urine studies show:\nUrine\nProtein\n3+\nRBC > 16/hpf\nWBC 2/hpf\nThere are no casts or dysmorphic RBCs visualized on microscopic analysis of the urine. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's hematuria?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tubular lumen obstruction by protein casts",
      "B": "Necrotizing inflammation of the renal glomeruli",
      "C": "Bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma",
      "D": "Vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of hematuria, flank pain, and costovertebral tenderness suggests a renal stone. The urinalysis shows 3+ protein, RBCs > 16/hpf, and WBCs 2/hpf. The absence of casts or dysmorphic RBCs suggests that the source of bleeding is glomerular. Glomerular bleeding is most often caused by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which is a common complication of hypertension.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
