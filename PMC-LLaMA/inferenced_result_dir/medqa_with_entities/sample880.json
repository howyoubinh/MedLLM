    "question": "A 21-year-old woman presents with sudden onset of high blood pressure. She is concerned about her health especially after her colleagues noticed that her face gets red at times while at work. She has even started to use blankets to cover her feet, even on the warmest days in the summer, even though her hands feel warm to the touch. She is a student who exercises and eats a well-balanced diet every day. There is no family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes. On examination, her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, respirations are 19/min, pulse is 64/min, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). An echocardiogram is ordered for investigation. This patient is likely affected by a condition which is associated with which of the following options?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Fibromuscular dysplasia",
      "B": "Marfan syndrome",
      "C": "Turner syndrome",
      "D": "Takayasu's arteritis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's age, gender, and blood pressure are suggestive of secondary hypertension. The presence of facial flushing suggests the possibility of a hyperthyroid state. The presence of hyperthyroidism along with facial flushing is suggestive of carcinoid syndrome. The echocardiogram is likely to show a normal heart, ruling out the possibility of pheochromocytoma. The presence of hyperthyroidism along with facial flushing is suggestive of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is associated with fibromuscular dysplasia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
