    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because she has a cord-like rash on her left calf that is red and painful to touch. She says that she has had multiple such lesions previously. Other medical history reveals that she has had 3 past spontaneous abortions at < 10 weeks of gestational age but has never been diagnosed with any diseases. She drinks socially but has never smoked or used drugs. She has never taken any medications except for over the counter analgesics and antipyretics. Physical exam shows that the cord-like lesion is tender, thick, and hardened on palpation. In addition, she has a lacy mottled violaceous rash on multiple extremities. Which of the following antibodies would most likely be found in this patient's blood?",
