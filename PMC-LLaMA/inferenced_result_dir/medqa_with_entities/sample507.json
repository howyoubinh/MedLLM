    "question": "A 68-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a cough, dyspnea, and fever for 1 day. The cough is productive of small amounts of green phlegm. He has metastatic colon cancer and has received three cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; his last chemotherapy session was 2.5 months ago. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone for acute exacerbations three times in the past year. His medications include a fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and a tiotropium bromide inhaler. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. His temperature is 39.1°C (103.1°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 88/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ceftriaxone and azithromycin",
      "B": "Ertapenem",
      "C": "Colistin",
      "D": "Cefepime and levofloxacin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is often polymicrobial. The most common organisms are gram-negative rods, so therapy should include a β-lactam with activity against these organisms, such as ceftriaxone or cefepime. The addition of azithromycin will cover atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella spp. Colistin is not indicated because it is a polymyxin and would not be effective against the likely pathogens. Vancomycin would not be effective against the likely pathogens.\n\n###COMMENTS:\n\nThe patient has risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, including hospitalization, recent use of prednisone, and recent use of antibiotics. Therefore, meropenem would not be the best choice because it does not cover P. aeruginosa.\n\nErtapenem is a β-lactam antibiotic indicated for the treatment of hospital- and community-acquired infections caused by susceptible organisms. It is resistant to many β-lactamases. However, it will not cover P. aeruginosa.\n\nCeftazidime is a β-lactam antibiotic indicated for the treatment of hospital- and community-acquired infections caused by susceptible organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
