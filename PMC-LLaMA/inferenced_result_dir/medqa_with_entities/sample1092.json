    "question": "A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for trouble sleeping. The patient states that he recently retired from working the day shift at a cemetery. When the patient retired, his goal was to finally be able to go out with his wife; however, he finds that he is unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening. His inability to stay awake has been straining his marriage as his wife is disappointed that they cannot do any activities in the evening together. The patient has tried drinking caffeine but finds that it does not help. The patient’s wife claims that the patient seems to sleep peacefully, and the patient states he feels rested when he awakes. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome which is managed with fiber supplements. The patient’s neurological exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Obstructive sleep apnea",
      "B": "Advanced sleep phase disorder",
      "C": "Chronic insomnia",
      "D": "Normal aging"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s history of retiring and the change in his sleep pattern suggest advanced sleep phase disorder. Advanced sleep phase disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder in which the patient’s sleep-wake schedule is advanced relative to the desired or conventional schedule. The patient falls asleep earlier in the evening and wakes up earlier in the morning. Advanced sleep phase disorder is more common in the elderly. The patient’s lack of ability to stay awake in the evening and his early morning awakening are consistent with advanced sleep phase disorder. The patient’s lack of daytime sleepiness and his feeling of being rested after sleep are also consistent with this diagnosis. Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by loud snoring, interrupted breathing during sleep, and daytime sleepiness. The patient does not have these symptoms. Chronic insomnia is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or having nonrestorative sleep for at least 1 month. The patient does not have these symptoms. Normal aging is not a diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
