    "question": "A 10-year-old Caucasian female with Turner's syndrome underwent an abdominal imaging study and was discovered that the poles of her kidneys were fused inferiorly. Normal ascension of kidney during embryological development would be prevented by which of the following anatomical structures?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Superior mesenteric artery",
      "B": "Inferior mesenteric artery",
      "C": "Celiac artery",
      "D": "Splenic artery"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The superior mesenteric artery is the most inferior of the options provided that would prevent the normal ascension of the kidneys during embryological development. The superior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta, posterior to the neck of the pancreas and then descends behind the splenic vein and the body of the pancreas. The inferior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta, and passes to the left behind the horizontal duodenum and the left renal vein. The celiac artery arises from the aorta immediately below the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm at the level of T12/L1 vertebral bodies. The splenic artery arises from the celiac trunk, and passes horizontally to the left along the upper border of the pancreas.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

For plant vegetative embryos, this would be from the initial determination of the cell or group of cells to form an embryo until the point when the embryo becomes independent of the parent plant.
