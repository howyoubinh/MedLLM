    "question": "A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for vision changes. About 90 minutes ago she was on the couch watching television with her husband when she suddenly noticed that she couldn't see the screen normally. She also felt a little dizzy. She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Internal carotid artery",
      "B": "Anterior cerebral artery",
      "C": "Posterior cerebral artery",
      "D": "Basilar artery"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The posterior cerebral artery supplies the coical surface of the occipital lobe, which is the primary visual cortex. Occlusion of this vessel causes visual field defects. The anterior cerebral artery supplies the medial surface of the frontal and parietal lobes. The internal carotid artery supplies the brain stem, basilar artery, and cerebellum. The basilar artery supplies the pons and medulla. The vertebral artery supplies the medulla.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
