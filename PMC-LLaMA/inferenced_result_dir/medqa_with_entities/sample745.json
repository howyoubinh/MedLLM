    "question": "A 63-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease complains of feeling lightheaded after her hemodialysis sessions for the past month. She worries she might eventually lose her balance and fall. She has had diabetes mellitus for 22 years. Her medications include folic acid, vitamin B12, amlodipine, and erythropoietin. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg when lying down before dialysis and 110/55 mm Hg when seated after hemodialysis. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies after hemodialysis show a Hb of 10.5 mg/dL, a blood sugar of 189 mg/dL, and a hemoglobin A1C of 7.1%. To reduce the likelihood of falls, the most appropriate management is which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cooling the dialysate",
      "B": "Eating heavier meals during dialysis",
      "C": "Increasing ultrafiltration",
      "D": "Steroid administration"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's lightheadedness is likely due to orthostatic hypotension, which is a common complication of hemodialysis, especially among diabetics. During dialysis, blood volume is decreased disproportionately to the reduction in extracellular fluid volume, resulting in a decrease in cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. The best way to prevent this complication is to increase the ultrafiltration rate during dialysis. Cooling the dialysate would lead to vasoconstriction and a decrease in the temperature gradient, thereby reducing the rate of solute removal. Eating heavier meals during dialysis would increase the blood sugar and worsen the diabetes. Steroid administration would worsen the diabetes.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
