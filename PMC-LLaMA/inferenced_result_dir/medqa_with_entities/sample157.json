A venous blood sample obtained for routine screening tests is milky. After refrigeration, a creamy supernatant layer appears on top of the sample. Genetic analysis shows a mutation in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2) on chromosome 19. This patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following complications?",
