    "question": "A 43-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and current intravenous drug use presents with 5 days of fever, chills, headache, and severe back pain. On physical exam, temperature is 100.6 deg F (38.1 deg C), blood pressure is 109/56 mmHg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 18/min. He is thin and diaphoretic with pinpoint pupils, poor dentition, and track marks on his arms and legs. A high-pitched systolic murmur is heard, loudest in the left sternal border and with inspiration. He is admitted to the hospital and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. One of the blood cultures drawn 12 hours ago returns positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Repeat blood cultures now",
      "B": "Repeat blood cultures 24 hours after initial cultures were drawn",
      "C": "Repeat blood cultures 48 hours after initial cultures were drawn",
      "D": "Do not repeat blood cultures"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of endocarditis in this patient is to repeat blood cultures 48 hours after initial cultures were drawn. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use, which puts him at risk for endocarditis. The fevers, murmur, and positive blood culture all suggest endocarditis. The diagnosis of endocarditis is confirmed by positive blood cultures. The American Heart Association recommends that cultures be drawn within 30 minutes of initial antibiotic therapy. If the cultures are negative, the patient should be observed for 48 hours and cultures repeated before changing the antibiotics. The other answers listed are incorrect because they do not represent the recommended guidelines for repeat blood cultures.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
