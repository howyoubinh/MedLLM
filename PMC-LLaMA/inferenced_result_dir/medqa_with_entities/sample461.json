    "question": "A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because he is unable to achieve erections during sexual intercourse. He first noticed the problem 8 months ago, when he became sexually active with a new girlfriend. He states that his relationship with his girlfriend is good, but his inability to engage in sexual intercourse has been frustrating. He has hyperlipidemia and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago. He works as a lawyer and enjoys his job, but he has had a great deal of stress lately. He had not been sexually active for the previous 3 years, since the death of his wife. He does not smoke. He drinks 4–6 beers on weekends. Current medications include simvastatin and citalopram. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Pedal pulses are difficult to palpate. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Psychotherapy",
      "B": "Penile prosthesis insertion",
      "C": "Nocturnal penile tumescence testing",
      "D": "Switch citalopram to bupropion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's depression and hyperlipidemia are well controlled with citalopram and simvastatin, respectively. His lack of sexual desire is likely due to the major depressive disorder, which is currently well treated. The patient should be educated about the side effects of citalopram, which include decreased libido and orgasmic dysfunction. The patient should be reassured that these side effects often diminish over time. He should be counseled about stress reduction and lifestyle modification. He should also be educated about nocturnal penile tumescence testing, which can document whether he has normal nocturnal erections. This testing can help to distinguish between psychogenic erectile dysfunction and erectile dysfunction due to organic causes, such as vascular disease or neuropathy. The patient should be encouraged to continue regular exercise and to maintain a healthy diet. He should also be educated about the possibility of using a penile prosthesis or of applying topical vasodilators.\n\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
