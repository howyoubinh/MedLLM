    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 15 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.0 mg/dL\nUrine\nBlood 1+\nProtein 1+\nRBC 15–17/hpf\nWBC 1–2/hpf\nThe audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alport syndrome",
      "B": "Fabry’s disease",
      "C": "Von Hippel-Lindau disease",
      "D": "Tuberous sclerosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Alport syndrome is a type of hereditary nephritis characterized by progressive glomerulonephritis, sensorineural hearing loss, and eye defects. The most common defect is lenticonus, but other abnormalities such as posterior cataracts, retinal flecks, and corneal dystrophy can also occur. The disease is caused by a defect in the a3, a4, or a5 collagen chains, which are components of type IV collagen in the basement membrane of the glomeruli and in the capsule of the lens. The defect in type IV collagen leads to progressive glomerular destruction and results in hematuria, proteinuria, and eventual renal failure. The defect in type IV collagen in the lens capsule leads to the ocular abnormalities. Fabry’s disease is an X-linked disorder due to a defect in the enzyme ceramide trihexosidase. This defect results in an accumulation of trihexose in the vascular endothelium of many tissues. The disease is characterized by episodes of pain, fever, and skin changes. Renal involvement leads to proteinuria and progressive renal failure. The eye abnormalities include corneal and lenticular opacities and a peculiar whorl-like pattern of pigment deposition in the retina. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple vascular tumors in the cerebellum, retina, brain stem, and pancreas. Renal cysts are also common. Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mental retardation, seizures, and skin lesions (adenoma sebaceum and ash-leaf spots). Renal findings include angiomyolipomas and renal cysts.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
