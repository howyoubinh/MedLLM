    "question": "A 58-year-old woman presents to the office for routine follow-up. She recently underwent routine screening for bone density due to a history of hypothyroidism. She also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is being treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and more recently with a histamine2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), hypertension being treated with a thiazide diuretic, depression being treated with lithium, and hormone replacement therapy. Her results meet the criteria for osteopenia, with a T-score of -1.6. She is concerned about progressive bone loss and the risk of fractures. Which of the following medication classes should be discontinued?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Proton-pump inhibitors",
      "B": "Thiazide diuretics",
      "C": "Lithium",
      "D": "Estrogen"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The thiazide diuretic is the likely culprit in this case. Thiazide diuretics have been shown to cause hypocalcemia and decrease bone density. The PPI, H2RA, and estrogen are all likely to help decrease the risk of osteoporosis. Lithium is not typically associated with osteoporosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
