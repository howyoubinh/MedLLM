    "question": "A 39-year-old man is brought to the emergency department unconscious following 2 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. According to the attendants, he has complained of recurrent headaches for the past 2 weeks. There is no history of fever, head trauma, or a seizure disorder. The patient does not smoke cigarettes but reportedly drinks 2 glasses of wine daily. He has multiple sexual partners and history regarding the contraceptive use is unavailable. The patient’s vitals include: blood pressure 137/88 mm Hg, temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical examination, he is obtunded. He grimaces on pain and localizes in response to pain in both upper extremities. Pupils are bilateral 3-mm in diameter and equally round and reactive. Laboratory tests are within normal limits. An MRI of the brain with contrast is shown in the exhibit (see image). A brain biopsy is performed that reveals perivascular clusters of lymphocytes. Which of the following is most associated with this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Epstein-Barr virus",
      "B": "Human herpes virus",
      "C": "Human papilloma virus",
      "D": "Schistosoma haematobium"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s obtunded state and the MRI showing contrast enhancement of the brain is consistent with viral encephalitis. The CSF analysis reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis, which is also consistent with viral encephalitis. The brain biopsy showing perivascular clusters of lymphocytes is consistent with a viral encephalitis. The most common cause of viral encephalitis in an immunocompetent patient is HSV-1. The most common cause of viral encephalitis in patients with AIDS is CMV. The Epstein-Barr virus is associated with the development of lymphomas in immunocompromised patients. Human herpes virus is associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma in patients with AIDS. Human papilloma virus is associated with the development of cervical cancer. Schistosoma haematobium is associated with the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. Ref: Roos K.L., Tyler K.L. (2012). Chapter 381.
