    "question": "A 40-year-old man presents to his primary-care doctor for a follow-up of his hypertension. He is asymptomatic at his office visit and denies any new complaints. He has a 10-year history of hypertension that remains poorly controlled on maximum doses of lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine. His past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He has no smoking history, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies any illicit drug use. His father required a kidney transplant in his forties. The physical exam is notable for palpable flank masses bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a creatinine of 2.5. The physician orders a renal ultrasound, and the results are shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Colonoscopy",
      "B": "Esophagogastroduodenoscopy",
      "C": "Liver function tests",
      "D": "MR angiography of the brain"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The ultrasound shows multiple cysts in both kidneys. ADPKD is associated with liver cysts, intracranial aneurysms, and colonic diveicula. The most common complication of ADPKD is renal failure. The most common complication of renal failure in ADPKD is cardiovascular disease. Therefore, screening for coronary artery disease with a stress test or coronary angiography is not indicated. Colonoscopy is indicated in patients with ADPKD at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest age at which a first-degree relative was diagnosed with colon cancer, whichever comes first. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is not indicated in this patient. Liver function tests are not indicated in this patient. MR angiography of the brain is not indicated in this patient.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
