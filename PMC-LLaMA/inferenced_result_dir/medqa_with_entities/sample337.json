    "question": "A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient’s condition?",

  "model_response": "The physiological changes of pregnancy that affect this patient’s condition are:\n\nIncrease in heart rate\nIncrease in cardiac output\nIncrease in blood volume\nDecrease in systemic vascular resistance\n\nThis patient has a congenital heart defect, probably an atrial septal defect (ASD). The increase in cardiac output and the decrease in systemic vascular resistance during pregnancy will increase the shunt across the ASD, leading to worsening of the patient’s symptoms.\n\nThe increase in heart rate during pregnancy will also contribute to the murmur intensity. The increase in blood volume contributes to the increase in cardiac output.\n\nThe increase in body temperature during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in abdominal pressure due to the growing uterus will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in respiratory rate during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in renal blood flow during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in gastrointestinal activity during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in glomerular filtration rate during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in intravascular volume during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in hematocrit during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in progesterone levels during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in intrapulmonary pressure during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in minute ventilation during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in oxygen consumption during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in renal blood flow during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in uterine blood flow during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in venous pressure during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in body weight during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in diaphragm elevation during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in subcostal angle during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in transverse diameter of the chest during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the chest during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the inferior vena cava during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the right ventricle during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the left atrium during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the right atrium during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the pulmonary artery during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the aorta during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the left ventricle during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the right ventricular outflow tract during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the vena cavae during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the aortic root during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the pulmonary artery during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.\n\nThe increase in the size of the atrial septum during pregnancy will not affect the intensity of the murmur.",
