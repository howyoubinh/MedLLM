    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen",
      "B": "Adding lisinopril to his treatment regimen",
      "C": "Liver transplantation",
      "D": "Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has developed hepatorenal syndrome, which is a complication of end-stage liver disease. Hepatorenal syndrome is characterized by progressive oliguria and reduction in glomerular filtration rate in the setting of end-stage liver disease. It is associated with a poor prognosis. Treatment options are limited. Patients who are treated with terlipressin (a vasopressin analogue) and albumin have a higher chance of survival. Patients who are treated with midodrine (an alpha-1 agonist) and octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) have a higher chance of survival. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and is not indicated in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. Dopamine is a vasopressor and is not indicated in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting is a surgical procedure that may be indicated in patients with refractory ascites. Liver transplantation is not likely to be an option for this patient due to his history of alcohol use disorder and end-stage liver disease.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

      "definition": "<h3>What is alcohol use disorder (AUD)?</h3> <p>For most adults, moderate <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcohol.html\">alcohol</a> use is probably not harmful. However, about 18 million adult Americans have an alcohol use disorder (AUD). This means that their drinking causes distress and harm. AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.</p> <p>AUD is a disease that causes</p> <ul> <li>Craving - a strong need to drink</li> <li>Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've started</li> <li>Negative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking</li> </ul> <h3>What is binge drinking?</h3> <p>Binge drinking is drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one.</p> <h3>What are the dangers of too much alcohol?</h3> <p>Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver diseases</a>, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fattyliverdisease.html\">fatty liver disease</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html\">cirrhosis</a>. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fetalalcoholspectrumdisorders.html\">harm your baby</a>. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide.</p> <h3>How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)?</h3> <p>You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:</p> <p>In the past year, have you</p> <ul> <li>Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to?</li> <li>Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't?</li> <li>Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking?</li> <li>Felt a strong need to drink?</li> <li>Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school?</li> <li>Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?</li> <li>Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink?</li> <li>Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex.</li> <li>Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem?</li> <li>Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol?</li> <li>Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html\">anxiety</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/depression.html\">depression</a>, restlessness, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/nauseaandvomiting.html\">nausea</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sweat.html\">sweating</a>. In severe cases, you could have a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html\">fever</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/seizures.html\">seizures</a>, or hallucinations.</li> </ul> <p>If you have any of these symptoms, your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more serious the problem is.</p> <h3>What should I do if I think that I might have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)?</h3> <p>If you think you might have an AUD, see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/alcoholusedisorderaudtreatment.html\">treatment plan</a>, prescribe medicines, and if needed, give you treatment referrals.</p> <p class=\"\">NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</p>"
