    "question": "A 61-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Her last Pap smear 3 years ago showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. HPV testing was negative at that time. On questioning, she has had fatigue and an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Menarche was at the age of 10 years and her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. Current medications include omeprazole and levothyroxine. Abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. There is tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound. Bimanual palpation shows a small uterus and a right adnexal mass. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Elevated serum CA-125 level",
      "B": "Elevated serum beta-hCG level",
      "C": "Prolonged prothrombin time",
      "D": "Cervical dysplasia on Pap smear"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a pelvic mass and adnexal tenderness, which raise concern for ovarian cancer. Her age, however, is more consistent with the diagnosis of endometrial cancer. The history of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance raises concern for cervical dysplasia. The most common presenting symptoms of endometrial cancer are postmenopausal bleeding and nonmenstrual bleeding. Symptoms of advanced disease include weight loss, abdominal pain, and a change in bowel function. The most common presenting symptom of ovarian cancer is abdominal pain. Physical findings include ascites, a pelvic mass, and tenderness. The most common presenting symptom of cervical cancer is postcoital bleeding. Physical findings include an exophytic mass and cervical dysplasia. The most common presenting symptom of fallopian tube cancer is watery vaginal discharge. Physical findings include a pelvic mass and adnexal tenderness. The most common presenting symptom of vaginal cancer is postmenopausal bleeding. Physical findings include a pelvic mass and vaginal lesions.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
