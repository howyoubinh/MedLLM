    "question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fever, cough, purulent nasal discharge. She has experienced 7 similar episodes, each lasting 2–5 days in the previous 2 years. She has also had intermittent abdominal cramps and recurrent episodes of foul-smelling greasy diarrhea in the past year. She is at the 55th percentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an erythematous oropharynx without exudate and tenderness over the frontoethmoidal sinuses. The abdomen is distended, nontender, and tympanitic to percussion. Bowel sounds are increased. Stool microscopy shows pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?",
