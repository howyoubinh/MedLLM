    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being stabbed 12 times in various parts of his body. Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95째F (35째C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same. The surgical team reports no active blood loss. A stat ScvO2 results as 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen. His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80째F (26.7째C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cardiac tamponade",
      "B": "Cervical spinal cord transection",
      "C": "Pulmonary embolism",
      "D": "Undiagnosed pneumonia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with a massive transfusion, which is evidenced by his hemodynamic stability and oxygenation. His cold extremities and low ScvO2 are concerning for hypovolemic shock due to occult bleeding. The patient's oxygenation is likely suffering due to a combination of his underlying injury and his body's inability to extract oxygen from the blood due to his hypothermia. The patient's presentation is not consistent with cardiac tamponade, cervical spinal cord transection, pulmonary embolism, or undiagnosed pneumonia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
