    "question": "A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent fevers for the past 6 months. He has had sexual intercourse with multiple men and women over the past year and does not use barrier protection. His last screen for sexually transmitted diseases was 10 years ago and was normal. His past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. He was involved in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago and suffered multiple fractured bones in his upper and lower extremities, all of which have healed. He has a distant history of cocaine abuse. He drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week. His temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, he appears cachectic but is pleasant and appropriately interactive. An HIV differentiation assay and follow-up Western blot are performed and are positive. The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hepatotoxicity",
      "B": "Lipodystrophy",
      "C": "Myelosuppression",
      "D": "Peripheral neuropathy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing lipodystrophy as a result of the change in medication regimen. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that is frequently used as a booster for other protease inhibitors to improve their pharmacokinetics and lower the risk of developing resistance. Ritonavir itself is not frequently used as a first-line agent because of its side-effect profile, which includes lipodystrophy, hyperlipidemia, and gastrointestinal side effects. Lipodystrophy is a disorder characterized by abnormal fat distribution and can result in loss of fat from the face and limbs and accumulation of fat in the abdomen and breasts. This metabolic abnormality is frequently seen in patients taking protease inhibitors. Myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatotoxicity are more commonly associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Efavirenz binds directly to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, blocking its function in viral DNA replication. In combination with other antiretroviral drugs, this agent has been shown to significantly reduce HIV viral load, retarding or preventing damage to the immune system and reducing the risk of developing AIDS. Efavirenz induces activity of the cytochrome P450 system, accelerating its own metabolism."
