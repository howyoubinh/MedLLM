    "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the complaint of pain in his right toe for the past hour. The pain is so severe that it woke him up. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and binge drinks alcohol after work and on the weekends. He underwent an appendectomy when he was 14 years old. He is a long-distance truck driver. Neither of his parents had any significant medical history. His temperature is 37.7°C (100°F), blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and BMI is 25 kg/m2. On examination, his right first metatarsophalangeal joint is very tender, swollen, warm, and red in color. Range of motion cannot be assessed due to extreme tenderness.\nLaboratory test\nComplete blood count:\nHemoglobin 11.5 g/dL\nLeukocytes 16,000/mm3\nPlatelets 150,000/mm3\nESR 50 mm/hr\nSynovial fluid is aspirated from the joint. The findings are:\nAppearance Cloudy, dense yellow\nWBC 30,000 cells/µL\nCulture Negative\nNeedle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion",
      "B": "Increased renal reabsorption of urate",
      "C": "Deficiency of HGPRT",
      "D": "High-purine diet"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical and laboratory findings are consistent with acute gouty arthritis. The most common joint involved in the first attack of gout is the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The patient’s history of smoking, alcohol use, and surgery (appendectomy) are risk factors for gout. The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals (negatively birefringent) in the joint aspirate is diagnostic of gout. Hyperuricemia is not always present in gout, especially in the early stages. The most common causes of hyperuricemia are increased turnover of nucleic acids, obesity, and alcohol use. The treatment of choice for acute gout is NSAIDs.\n\nOrganic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion (Option A) is a mechanism of drug-induced hyperuricemia. Drugs that interfere with urate excretion are pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and diuretics.\nIncreased renal reabsorption of urate (Option B) is a mechanism of drug-induced hyperuricemia. Drugs that interfere with urate excretion are pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and diuretics.\nDeficiency of HGPRT (Option C) is a cause of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is characterized by self-mutilation, choreoathetosis, spasticity, and mental retardation.\nHigh-purine diet (Option D) is a risk factor for gout, but the patient’s history does not suggest a high-purine diet.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
