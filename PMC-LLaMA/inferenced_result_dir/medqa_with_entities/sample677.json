    "question": "A 2-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department by her mother due to a fall. Tearfully, the patient’s mother describes witnessing her child fall from the changing table. The patient was born prematurely at 36 weeks estimated gestational age via vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery. The patient is afebrile. Her vital signs include: blood pressure of 94/60 mm Hg, pulse 200/min, and respiratory rate 70/min. Physical examination reveals a subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye and multiple bruises on the chest and back. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "CT scan of the head",
      "B": "Involvement of social services",
      "C": "Family counseling",
      "D": "Rule out medical conditions"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s presentation is consistent with physical abuse. The initial step in management is to ensure the child’s safety. This requires involvement of both medical and social services. The child should be admitted to the hospital and a thorough evaluation, including a CT scan of the head to rule out intracranial trauma, should be performed. Family counseling may be offered after an evaluation for medical and psychological conditions that may contribute to the abuse.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
