On presentation, he is found to have scalp and trunk lacerations that are still actively bleeding. He has no past medical history and does not take any medications. On presentation, his temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/74 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical exam, he is found to be anxious but does not have any visible injuries other than the lacerations. Which of the following processes would most likely be seen in this patient?",
