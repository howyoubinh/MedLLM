    "question": "A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Asbestos inhalation",
      "B": "Neoplastic transformation",
      "C": "Opportunistic colonization",
      "D": "Abscess formation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a lung abscess. Lung abscesses are most commonly caused by aspiration of oral flora. The presence of a radiopaque mass suggests a neoplasm, which could be a metastasis. The history of pulmonary tuberculosis suggests that the patient has a weakened immune system, which could predispose him to opportunistic colonization. Asbestos inhalation can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and carcinoma.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
