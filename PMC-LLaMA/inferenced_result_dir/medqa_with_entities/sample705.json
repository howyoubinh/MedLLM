    "question": "A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Diabetic polyuria",
      "B": "Primary polydipsia",
      "C": "Urethral hypermobility",
      "D": "Vescicovaginal fistula"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are most consistent with urethral hypermobility. The patient’s history of progressive urinary incontinence, which has worsened to the point of leakage with coughing and laughter, is typical of urethral hypermobility. This condition is often seen in multiparous women and is caused by weakening of the support of the urethra and bladder neck. The patient’s history of a previous cesarean section and large amounts of fluid intake likely contribute to this condition. The negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin rules out pregnancy. Primary polydipsia is unlikely because the patient’s specific gravity is within normal limits. Although diabetic polyuria can cause urinary incontinence, the patient’s symptoms of leakage with coughing and laughter are more consistent with urethral hypermobility. A vesicovaginal fistula should be suspected in patients with a history of recent gynecologic surgery, pelvic trauma, or radiation. The patient’s history does not include these risk factors.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
