    "question": "A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",
