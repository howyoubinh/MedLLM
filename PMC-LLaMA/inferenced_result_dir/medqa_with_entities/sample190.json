    "question": "A 23-year-old college student presents to the clinic with a history of intermittent chest discomfort. He reports that, about once per month for the past 8 or 9 months, he's had episodes of \"feeling like my chest is going to explode.\" During these episodes, he also feels shortness of breath, feels shakiness throughout his arms and legs, and sweats so heavily that he needs to change his shirt. He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Citalopram",
      "B": "Lithium",
      "C": "Propranolol",
      "D": "Quetiapine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with panic disorder, which is characterized by discrete episodes of intense fear or discomfort, associated with a number of physical symptoms, including palpitations, sweating, shakiness, shortness of breath, and a feeling of choking. The episodes are often abrupt in onset and offset, typically lasting 10 to 30 minutes. The symptoms cause significant distress, and the patient often develops anxiety about having additional episodes. The episodes may occur in specific situations, such as when the patient is in a crowd or in traffic, or they may occur \"out of the blue.\" The diagnosis is panic disorder with agoraphobia (the avoidance of situations that might precipitate a panic attack). The first-line medications for panic disorder are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram. Other medications that are effective include the tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine, and the selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SARI), such as venlafaxine. Benzodiazepines can also be used in the initial acute treatment of panic disorder, but long-term use is discouraged because of the potential for addiction and tolerance. Lithium is used primarily for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Propranolol is a beta blocker that is sometimes used to treat anxiety symptoms, but it is not the first-line treatment for panic disorder. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is sometimes used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not the first-line treatment for panic disorder.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
