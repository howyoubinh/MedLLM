    "question": "A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of sudden severe pain in his right great toe. Four months ago, he had an episode of severe joint pain involving his left knee that lasted several days and resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. Examination shows erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint; range of movement is limited by pain. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL. Arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is shown. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin",
      "B": "Inhibition of phospholipase A",
      "C": "Inhibition of xanthine oxidase",
      "D": "Increased renal excretion of urate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical and laboratory findings are most consistent with acute gouty arthritis. The synovial fluid findings are classic for urate crystal deposition. Uric acid is produced from the metabolism of purines and is eliminated by the kidneys. Increased production or decreased excretion can lead to hyperuricemia. The most common cause of hyperuricemia is decreased excretion. Drugs that inhibit uric acid synthesis (e.g., allopurinol) are used in the long-term management of gout. These agents increase conversion of uric acid to allantoin, a more soluble end product. Drugs that inhibit phospholipase A2 (e.g., indomethacin) are useful in the treatment of acute gout but are not appropriate for long-term management. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol) are used in the long-term management of gout. These agents inhibit the conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Drugs that increase renal excretion of urate (e.g., probenecid) are not used in the long-term management of gout. These agents may actually aggravate the condition by increasing the serum uric acid level.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
