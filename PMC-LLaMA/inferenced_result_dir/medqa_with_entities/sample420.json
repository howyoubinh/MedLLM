    "question": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of a learning disability. His teachers have reported hyperactivity during class, difficulties with social interaction, and poor scores on reading and writing assessments. Molecular analysis shows an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats. Which of the following findings are most likely to be seen on physical examination of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Frontal balding and cataracts",
      "B": "Long face and large everted ears",
      "C": "Almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth",
      "D": "Thin upper lip and receding chin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The molecular abnormality is Fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of inherited mental retardation. The physical findings are those of the fragile X syndrome: a long face with large everted ears, a long mandible, and large testicles. The syndrome gets its name from the karyotypic appearance of the X chromosome, which shows a discontinuity of staining or \"fragility\" in the distal long arm. This is due to an amplification of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene, which encodes a putative transcription factor. The amplification is a trinucleotide repeat expansion, as found in other trinucleotide repeat disorders such as Huntington disease and myotonic dystrophy. The X-linked inheritance pattern is due to the FMR1 gene's location on the X chromosome. The other choices are not characteristic of this disorder.\n\nDiagnosis: Fragile X",
