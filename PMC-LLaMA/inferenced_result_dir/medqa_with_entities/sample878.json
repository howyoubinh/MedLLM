    "question": "A 17-year-old high school student was in shop class when he accidentally sawed off his pointer finger while making a bird house. He fainted when he realized his finger had been cut off. The teacher immediately transported the patient to the emergency department and he arrived within 20 minutes. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his only medication is an albuterol inhaler. The patient's current blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg. Analgesics are administered. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but that the principal would be transporting it to the hospital. Which of the following is the correct method of transporting the amputated finger?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Submerge the finger in ice water",
      "B": "Wrap the finger in moist gauze",
      "C": "Wrap finger in moist gauze, put in a plastic bag, and place on ice",
      "D": "Wrap the finger in moist gauze and submerge in ice water"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The amputated finger should be wrapped in moist gauze, placed in a plastic bag, and put on ice. The plastic bag should be sealed and placed in a Styrofoam container with an ice pack. This keeps the finger sufficiently moist and chilled without freezing. The amputated finger should be taken to the nearest emergency department or hospital and transplanted as soon as possible. Delay can result in significant loss of function or total necrosis of the finger.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
