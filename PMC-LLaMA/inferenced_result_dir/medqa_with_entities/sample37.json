    "question": "A 3-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician with persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and signs and symptoms suggestive of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. His weight is in the 10th percentile. He is being evaluated for an immunodeficiency disease. Laboratory results for the HIV are negative by PCR. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Defective T cell function",
      "B": "Grossly reduced levels of B cells",
      "C": "Defective isotype switching",
      "D": "Selective IgA deficiency"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with failure to thrive. The most common cause of SCID is the X-linked mutation in the common g chain for cytokine receptors. These patients lack T and B cells and have grossly reduced levels of natural killer cells. They are vulnerable to a wide range of opportunistic infections. The other choices are not consistent with the clinical findings.Diagnosis: Severe combined immunodeficiency\n\n### COMMENTS: SCID is a group of genetically distinct syndromes, all having in common defects in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The most common form is X-linked, accounting for about 50% of autosomal recessive cases. The genetic defect is in the common g chain for cytokine receptors, which is shared by the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. This defect prevents the signal transduction necessary for the development and maturation of T and B cells. Patients are prone to infection by a wide range of organisms, including Candida albicans, P. jiroveci, CMV, varicella, and bacteria. They also may have chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. The other choices are not consistent with the clinical findings.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
