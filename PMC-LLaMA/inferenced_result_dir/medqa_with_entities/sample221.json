    "question": "A 2,300 g (5 lb) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer zidovudine",
      "B": "HIV DNA testing",
      "C": "HIV RNA testing",
      "D": "Reassurance and follow-up"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This infant should be treated with zidovudine (A) for 4-6 weeks following birth. HIV DNA (B) and RNA (C) testing are not recommended at this time. The infant should be followed (D) with HIV testing at 14-21 days, 2-4 months, 4-6 months, 9 months, and 12-18 months of age. The infant should also receive B-cell clonal disorders (e.g., lymphoproliferative disease) and may be at increased risk for HIV-associated neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
