    "question": "A 3rd year resident in good standing with his residency training program would like to work more hours outside his residency obligations to gain more experience and pay for his medical school loans. He currently works and trains 60 hours per week as a resident and has a 10-hour shift external to his residency program on Saturdays. He is free of any educational and work obligations on Sundays. Based on the most recent standards set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety?",
    "options": {
      "A": "He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours",
      "B": "He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training",
      "C": "He may work longer shifts",
      "D": "He may work up to 20 more hours"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'A': False, as he is already working 60 hours per week as a resident, so adding 10 hours of moonlighting is not overcommitting. Moonlighting hours must not be counted towards the 80-hour maximum hours per week limit.', 'B': False, as the ACGME does not prohibit residents from working outside the scope of their residency training. However, the institution where the resident is training must ensure that the education provided is the primary focus.', 'C': False, as the ACGME has not set any specific limit on shift length. However, shift length must be within the 80-hour per week limit.', 'D': True, as the ACGME allows a maximum of 10 hours per week of moonlighting, which must be in addition to the 80-hour per week limit for resident work hours. Moonlighting hours must not be counted towards the 80-hour maximum hours per week limit.}</s><s>",
