    "question": "A previously healthy 29-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of burning with urination for several days. He has also had pain in the right ankle for 3 days and pain and swelling in the left knee for 1 day. Two weeks ago, he had several days of fever and bloody diarrhea, for which he was treated with antibiotics. Examination shows a small left knee effusion and bilateral conjunctival injection. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Circular erythematous rash with central clearing",
      "B": "Pain on passive extension of the fingers",
      "C": "Palpable mass in the right lower quadrant",
      "D": "Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has several findings of reactive (spondylo)arthritis, including the characteristic triad of urethritis (burning with urination), conjunctivitis (circular erythematous rash with central clearing), and arthritis (pain on passive extension of the fingers). The Achilles tendinitis (tenderness at the insertion) is also common. The joints of the lower extremities, especially the knees, ankles, and subtalar, metatarsophalangeal, and toe interphalangeal joints, are most often involved. The arthritis is typically asymmetric, and the joints of the upper extremities and the axial skeleton may also be involved. The initial triggering infection is usually in the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
