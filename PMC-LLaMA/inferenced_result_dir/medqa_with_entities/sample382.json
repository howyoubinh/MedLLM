    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite, and low concentration for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Duloxetine",
      "B": "Trazodone",
      "C": "Bupropion",
      "D": "Citalopram"
    }

  "model_response": "The history is suggestive of recurrent major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern (worsening in the fall and winter months). The patient should be treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as citalopram, or an SNRI, such as duloxetine. Trazodone is an antidepressant that can cause priapism and is not commonly used. Bupropion is an antidepressant that can lower the seizure threshold and is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure disorder.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
