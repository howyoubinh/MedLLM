    "question": "A 39-year-old man seeks an evaluation in the emergency room due to an episode of syncope at work. He says that he has felt increasing shortness of breath while exercising over the past 6 months. He is a well-built man in mild distress. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. The cardiac examination is significant for a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole. Which of the following is most consistent with these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Aortic stenosis",
      "B": "Cardiac tamponade",
      "C": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
      "D": "Third-degree heart block"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings are most consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The harsh systolic ejection murmur is characteristic. The finding of a closely spaced carotid pulse which occurs during systole is called a \"water hammer\" pulse or Corrigan's pulse. This finding is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. The other choices do not include systolic ejection murmurs.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

In emergency and/or for short-time use, esophageal obturation with one- or two-lumen tubes and oropharyngeal artificial airways are typically used. For a few days of intubation, nasopharyngeal artificial airways are the most commonly used devices, while for longer periods (up to three weeks) endotracheal tubes are the preferred devices.
