    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of subacute back pain for the past month. The pain is described as a dull, constant ache that is worse at night. He could not recall any precipitating event except for an amateur weight-lifting competition that he participated in 2 months ago. Past medical history is significant for non-small cell lung cancer that was diagnosed and successfully treated. A PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence. Physical exam was unremarkable except for some point tenderness along the lumbosacral area. What is the most likely imaging finding in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve",
      "B": "Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine",
      "C": "Narrowing of the lumbar disc space",
      "D": "Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely imaging finding in this patient is lytic lesions of the lumbar spine. The clinical presentation is suggestive of metastatic disease to the lumbar spine. The patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer and the absence of any other significant findings on physical exam make this the most likely diagnosis. The PET scan 1 year ago demonstrating no recurrence makes it unlikely that the patient has a primary bone tumor. The imaging findings of metastatic disease to the lumbar spine can include lytic lesions, blastic lesions, or mixed lytic and blastic lesions. The lytic lesions can result in pathologic fractures. The lytic lesions can be single or multiple. The blastic lesions are usually associated with prostate cancer. The imaging findings of sacroiliitis and fusion of the lumbar spine are more characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. The imaging findings of a bulging disc impinging on a lumbar spinal nerve and narrowing of the lumbar disc space are more characteristic of degenerative disc disease.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
