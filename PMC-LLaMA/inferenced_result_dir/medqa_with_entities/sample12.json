    "question": "A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Renal cell carcinoma",
      "B": "Meningioma",
      "C": "Astrocytoma",
      "D": "Vascular malformations"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has neurofibromatosis type 2, which is characterized by bilateral tumors of the vestibular nerve (acoustic neuromas) and meningiomas. Acoustic neuromas are schwannomas that arise from the vestibular nerve. They may cause tinnitus, unilateral or bilateral hearing loss, or problems with balance. Meningiomas are tumors that arise from the dura mater and may cause seizures or focal neurologic deficits. Renal cell carcinoma is associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Astrocytoma is associated with tuberous sclerosis. Vascular malformations are associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
