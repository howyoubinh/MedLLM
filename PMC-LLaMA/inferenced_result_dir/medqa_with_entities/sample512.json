    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider concerned that she may be pregnant. She has a history of regular menstruation every 4 weeks that lasts about 4 days with mild to moderate bleeding, but she missed her last period 2 weeks ago. A home pregnancy test was positive. She has a 6-year history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with daily methimazole. She is currently asymptomatic and has no complaints or concerns. A blood specimen is taken and confirms the diagnosis. Additionally, her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 2.0 Î¼U/mL. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Continue methimazole",
      "B": "Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil",
      "C": "Add glucocorticoids",
      "D": "Refer for radioiodine therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has Graves disease, which is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disorder in which thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin binds to the TSH receptor and stimulates excessive release of thyroid hormone. The diagnosis is confirmed by a high T4 level and low TSH level. The treatment of choice is a beta-blocker to control symptoms such as tachycardia and tremor, followed by antithyroid medication. Methimazole and propylthiouracil are both effective in treating hyperthyroidism, but propylthiouracil is the antithyroid medication of choice in the first trimester of pregnancy because it has less transfer across the placenta. However, propylthiouracil is no longer available in the United States. Therefore, the best treatment for this patient is to continue methimazole.\n\nMethimazole crosses the placenta to a greater degree than propylthiouracil and has been associated with fetal aplasia cutis. However, propylthiouracil is associated with liver failure. Both medications are acceptable for use in the first trimester of pregnancy. The risk of birth defects is highest in the first trimester, and the risk of hypothyroidism is highest in the third trimester. Therefore, the best time to check a TSH level is after the first trimester, at 20-24 weeks. If the TSH level is elevated, then the dose of antithyroid medication should be increased.\n\nGlucocorticoids are not indicated in the treatment of Graves disease. Radioiodine therapy is also contraindicated in pregnancy because it may destroy the fetal thyroid tissue, leading to cretinism.\n\nThe patient should be counseled on the risks of pregnancy with hyperthyroidism, which include an increased risk of first trimester miscarriage, preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal thyrotoxicosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
