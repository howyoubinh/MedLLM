    "question": "A previously healthy, 24-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of loose, nonbloody stools. He also reports abdominal pain, intermittent nausea, and fever. He has not had vomiting, tenesmus, or rectal pain. His vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness of the right lower abdomen without rebound tenderness. Rectal exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 14,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 51 mm/h. Test of the stool for occult blood and stool studies for infection are negative. A CT scan of the abdomen shows mural thickening and surrounding fat stranding of discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon. A colonoscopy is performed and biopsy specimens of the affected areas of the colon are taken. Which of the following findings is most specific for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts",
      "B": "Neutrophil-rich pseudomembranes",
      "C": "Formation of noncaseating granulomas",
      "D": "Presence of pseudopolyps"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has Crohn disease, and the most specific finding is neutrophil-rich pseudomembranes affecting the mucosal surface. The other choices are features of ulcerative colitis. The transmural inflammation of Crohn disease can lead to strictures, adhesions, and fistulas. The etiology of Crohn disease is unknown, but there is evidence for both infectious and immune etiologies. The diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and histologic findings. The transmural inflammation can lead to skip lesions in the bowel, with intervening uninvolved bowel. The inflammation is characterized by neutrophil-rich infiltrates in the lamina propria, crypt abscesses, and, in some cases, the formation of noncaseating granulomas. The latter are not specific for Crohn disease and can be found in tuberculosis and sarcoidosis as well. The presence of pseudopolyps is characteristic of ulcerative colitis.\n\nGrainger: Diagnostic Radiology, 4th edition\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
