    "question": "A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ulnar artery",
      "B": "Flexor pollicis longus tendon",
      "C": "Flexor carpi radialis tendon",
      "D": "Ulnar nerve"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The tingling pain over the left hand is due to compression of the median nerve, and the mass is probably a ganglion cyst. The median nerve is in close proximity to the flexor pollicis longus tendon, which is at risk of entrapment if the mass persists. The ulnar artery is in close proximity to the flexor carpi radialis tendon, but this tendon is not at risk of entrapment. The ulnar nerve is in close proximity to the ulnar artery, but this nerve is not at risk of entrapment. The flexor carpi ulnaris tendon is in close proximity to the ulnar nerve, but this tendon is not at risk of entrapment.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
