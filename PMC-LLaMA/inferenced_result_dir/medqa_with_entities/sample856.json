    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for two weeks of low-grade fever and sore throat. Upon further questioning, the patient is found to have unprotected sex with both men and women with 3-5 partners per month. On workup, he is found to have an HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL with a CD4+ of 170 cells/mm^3. He is started on medical therapy. What should be included in his medication regimen?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Azithromycin",
      "B": "Fluconazole",
      "C": "Folinic acid",
      "D": "Tetrahydrofolic acid"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient should be started on a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an integrase inhibitor. The combination of two NRTIs (such as lamivudine and emtricitabine) plus an integrase inhibitor (such as elvitegravir) is the preferred initial regimen. The addition of a boosting agent (such as ritonavir or cobicistat) is also recommended. The addition of a fourth drug from another class (such as a protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) is also recommended. A pharmacological booster (such as folinic acid or tetrahydrofolic acid) is also recommended.\n\nGiven the patient's sexual history, the patient should also be started on a regimen of antibiotics for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections. Azithromycin is the drug of choice for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Fluconazole is the drug of choice for Cryptococcus neoformans and Coccidioides immitis.\n\nRegarding prevention of opportunistic infections, the patient should be given Cotrimoxazole for the prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
