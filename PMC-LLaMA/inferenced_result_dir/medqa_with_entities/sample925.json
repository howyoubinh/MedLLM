    "question": "A 6-month-old boy presents to a pediatrician for the evaluation of recurrent bacterial infections. He has a history of a variety of bacterial infections since birth. Physical examination reveals light-colored skin with silver-colored hair. The pediatrician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder and decides to order several tests. Study of the boy’s neutrophils reveals that they contain large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Genetic studies show a mutation in the LYST gene. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)",
      "B": "Common variable immunodeficiency",
      "C": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome",
      "D": "Leukocyte adhesion deficiency–1"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that arises from a mutation in the LYST gene, which encodes a protein called lysosomal trafficking regulator. The gene mutation results in abnormal fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes in neutrophils and other leukocytes. This fusion defect leads to impaired bactericidal activity and increased susceptibility to infections. The other choices do not feature a fusion defect in leukocytes.Diagnosis: Chediak-Higashi syndrome\n\n###COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNODEFICIENCY (CVID)\n\nCVID is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by decreased levels of IgG, with variable amounts of other immunoglobulin isotypes.\n\nCVID develops in early childhood or adolescence and is often preceded by a history of recurrent infections.\n\nThe most common cause of death in patients with CVID is chronic infection, often with Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also with other pathogens, including Pseudomonas, Hemophilus, and mycobacteria.\n\nThe most common physical findings in CVID are a small tonsil and lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe most common autoimmune complication of CVID is autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n\nThe most common malignancy in patients with CVID is non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n###LEUKOCYTE ADHESION DEFICIENCY–1\n\nLeukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-1) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that arises from a mutation in the ITGB2 gene, which encodes the integrin beta-2 subunit.\n\nThe beta-2 integrin is a cell adhesion molecule that is important for leukocyte migration and adhesion.\n\nPatients with LAD-1 have a defect in the ability of leukocytes to adhere to the endothelium and migrate to sites of infection.\n\nAs a result, patients with LAD-1 have recurrent bacterial infections, particularly of the skin and gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe physical examination in LAD-1 reveals a decreased ability to form pus, and patients have a decreased ability to migrate leukocytes to the skin after intradermal injection of the chemoattractant β-chemotaxis.\n\n###ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)\n\nAIDS is caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nThe virus preferentially infects CD4+ T cells, leading to a decrease in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells and, ultimately, to the development of cell-mediated immune deficiency.\n\nThe most common initial manifestation of HIV infection is a self-limited acute viral syndrome that develops 2-4 weeks after infection.\n\nThe physical examination in AIDS may be unremarkable or may reveal the characteristic findings of generalized lymphadenopathy and wasting.\n\n###COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNODEFICIENCY (CVID)\n\nCVID is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by decreased levels of IgG, with variable amounts of other immunoglobulin isotypes.\n\nCVID develops in early childhood or adolescence and is often preceded by a history of recurrent infections.\n\nThe most common cause of death in patients with CVID is chronic infection, often with Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also with other pathogens, including Pseudomonas, Hemophilus, and mycobacteria.\n\nThe most common physical findings in CVID are a small tonsil and lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe most common autoimmune complication of CVID is autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n\nThe most common malignancy in patients with CVID is non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n###LEUKOCY",
