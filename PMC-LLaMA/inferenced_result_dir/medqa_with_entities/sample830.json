    "question": "A 72-year-old man in a nursing home was brought to the emergency department with right hand and leg weakness for 1 hour. There has been a gradual increase in the degree of weakness. The patient is disoriented. The medical history includes ischemic heart disease diagnosed 2 months ago, and long histories of diabetes and hypertension (30 and 25 years, respectively). On examination, the reflexes are hypertonic and the Babinski reflex is positive. The CT scan is shown. What is the most likely pathologic change?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Gangrenous necrosis",
      "B": "Liquefactive necrosis",
      "C": "Caseous necrosis",
      "D": "Fibrinoid necrosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The CT scan shows a large hypodense area in the left cerebral hemisphere. The clinical presentation is consistent with an infarction of the left middle cerebral artery distribution. The CT scan is consistent with a large infarction. Liquefactive necrosis is the result of enzymatic breakdown of tissue and is characteristic of an ischemic infarction. Gangrenous necrosis is a form of coagulative necrosis that is typically seen in the extremities. Caseous necrosis is a form of necrosis that is seen in tuberculosis infections. Fibrinoid necrosis is a special form of necrosis that is seen in patients with rheumatic fever.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
