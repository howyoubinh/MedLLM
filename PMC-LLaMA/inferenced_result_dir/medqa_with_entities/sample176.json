    "question": "A novel type of PET radiotracer is being developed to evaluate patients with Parkinson’s disease. A clinical research study has enrolled 1,200 patients, half of whom have the disease. The scan is found to be positive in 590 of the 600 patients with known PD, and positive in 20 of the 600 patients without PD. What is the test’s overall specificity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "580 / (20 + 590)",
      "B": "580 / (10 + 580)",
      "C": "590 / (590 + 10)",
      "D": "580 / (580 + 20)"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The numerator is the number of true positives (590) plus the number of false positives (20). The denominator is the total number of positive cases (600) plus the number of negative cases (600). So, the overall specificity is 580 / (20 + 590).\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
