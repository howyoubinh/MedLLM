He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Muscle strength in the proximal lower extremity is initially 3/5 but increases to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping. His achilles reflex is 1+. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
