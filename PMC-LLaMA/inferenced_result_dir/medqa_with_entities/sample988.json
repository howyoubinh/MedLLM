    "question": "A researcher hypothesizes that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He conducts a study with a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Confidence interval should have been 90%.",
      "B": "A type 2 error is not possible in this case.",
      "C": "A type 2 error has been made.",
      "D": "A type 1 error has been made."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The researcher has made a type 1 error. A type 1 error is the rejection of a null hypothesis that is actually true. In this case, the researcher has concluded that low birth weight is associated with obesity when it is not. The confidence interval should have been 95% and not 99.5%. A type 2 error is not possible in this case because the researcher is trying to prove that low birth weight is associated with obesity, not the other way around.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
