    "question": " A 61-year-old man was started on rosuvastatin 40 mg 8 weeks ago and presents today for a follow-up. He complains of pain in his legs and general weakness. On physical exam, he has full range of motion of his extremities but complains of pain. His blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg and heart rate is 74/min. The decision is made to stop the statin and return to the clinic in 2 weeks to assess any changes in symptoms. After stopping the statin, his muscular symptoms resolve. What is the next best course of action to take regarding his LDL control?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Restart rosuvastatin at a lower dose",
      "B": "Initiate fenofibrate",
      "C": "Initiate a different statin",
      "D": "Initiate fish oils"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms of muscle pain (myalgias) and weakness are consistent with the side effects of statins. The myalgias are likely unrelated to the severity of his cholesterol elevation. The LDL goal for this patient is still 100 mg/dL. To achieve this goal, the patient could be restarted on rosuvastatin at a lower dose (10 mg daily). Fenofibrate is not indicated as a first-line agent in patients with normal triglyceride levels. A different statin could be initiated, but all statins have the potential to cause myalgias. Fish oils would not be a first-line choice for LDL control, and the patient has already tried a low-cholesterol diet.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

      "definition": "A statin with antilipidemic and potential antineoplastic activities. Rosuvastatin selectively and competitively binds to and inhibits hepatic hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. This leads to a decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels and increase in uptake of LDL cholesterol. In addition, rosuvastatin, like other statins, exhibits pro-apoptotic, growth inhibitory, and pro-differentiation activities in a variety of tumor cell types; these antineoplastic activities may be due, in part, to inhibition of the isoprenylation of Ras and Rho GTPases and related signaling cascades."
