    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a sudden loss of consciousness. He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6–24.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8–3.1). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
