    "question": "A 63-year-old man presents to the ambulatory medical clinic with symptoms of dysphagia and ‘heartburn’, which he states have become more troublesome over the past year. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and GERD. He takes lisinopril for hypertension and has failed multiple different therapies for his GERD. On physical exam, he is somewhat tender to palpation over his upper abdomen. Barium swallow demonstrates a subdiaphragmatic gastroesophageal junction, with herniation of the gastric fundus into the left hemithorax. Given the following options, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient’s underlying condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Lifestyle modification",
      "B": "Combined antacid therapy",
      "C": "Continue on Omeprazole",
      "D": "Surgical gastropexy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn, along with the finding of a subdiaphragmatic gastroesophageal junction on barium swallow, are consistent with the diagnosis of hiatal hernia. The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient’s underlying condition is surgical gastropexy.\n\nHiatal hernias are classified into four types. Type I or sliding hernias account for 80-90% of all hiatal hernias and occur when the gastroesophageal junction and fundus of the stomach slide into the left hemithorax through an enlarged hiatus. Type II or rolling hernias occur when the gastroesophageal junction and fundus of the stomach roll into the left hemithorax. Type III or mixed hernias are a combination of types I and II. Type IV or paraesophageal hernias occur when the gastroesophageal junction remains fixed and the stomach herniates next to the esophagus.\n\nThe initial management of a hiatal hernia is lifestyle modification, including dietary modification, antacids, and weight loss. However, if symptoms fail to improve with conservative measures, surgical intervention should be considered. The goals of surgical therapy are to (1) reduce the size of the hiatus, (2) repair the diaphragmatic defect, and (3) reposition the gastroesophageal junction in the abdomen.\n\nSurgical options include laparoscopic and open approaches. The laparoscopic approach is less invasive but may be associated with a higher risk of recurrence. The open approach is more invasive but has a lower risk of recurrence. The most commonly performed operation for a type I hiatal hernia is the Nissen fundoplication with a 360° wrap of the fundus of the stomach around the distal esophagus. The most commonly performed operation for a type II hiatal hernia is the Dor fundoplication with a 270° wrap of the fundus of the stomach around the distal esophagus.\n\nLifelong follow-up is necessary because of the risk of recurrence.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
