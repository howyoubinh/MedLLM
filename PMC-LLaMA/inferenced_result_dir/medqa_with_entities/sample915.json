    "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 12 weeks estimated gestational age presents with malaise, joint pain, fever, and chills for the past 3 days. Physical examination reveals a mild lace-like rash and arthritis. The patient mentions her friend who is a medical student told her that her symptoms are suggestive of a parvovirus B19 infection which may adversely affect her baby. Which of the following statements regarding the effect of parvovirus B19 infection in this pregnant patient is correct?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It can lead to hydrops fetalis secondary to fetal anemia.",
      "B": "It can cause aplastic crisis in the neonate.",
      "C": "Fetal loss occurs in more than 40% of primary infections.",
      "D": "The neonate may be born with a typical slapped-cheek rash."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient is infected with parvovirus B19. The virus has an affinity for erythroid progenitor cells and can lyse them. In the fetus, this can lead to aplastic crisis with severe anemia. The risk of fetal loss is less than 5% and hydrops fetalis is rare. The slapped-cheek appearance is seen in about 50% of adults infected with parvovirus B19. Neonates may be infected in utero and may have a similar rash.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
