    "question": "A 36-year-old G3P2 woman with no significant past medical history delivers a 3.7 kg (8 lb, 3 oz) baby boy following an uncomplicated pregnancy. On physical examination in the delivery room, the pediatrician notes that the baby has upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, a flat facial profile, small ears, a single palmar crease, and hypotonia. When discussing the diagnosis with the parents, which of the following is this baby at an increased risk for having?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tetralogy of Fallot",
      "B": "Omphalocele",
      "C": "Congenital cataracts",
      "D": "Cleft lip"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This baby is at increased risk for Down syndrome (trisomy 21). The facial features described are typical of this condition. Other features include a single transverse palmar crease, a gap between the first and second toe (known as \"sandle gap\"), and in females, a wide and short neck. Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for other conditions, including tetralogy of Fallot, congenital cataracts, and cleft lip. Omphalocele is a risk for in utero demise, not a condition associated with Down syndrome.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
