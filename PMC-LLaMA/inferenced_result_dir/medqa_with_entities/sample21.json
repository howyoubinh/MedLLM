    "question": "A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?",
    "options": {
      "A": "22q11 deletion",
      "B": "Deletion of genes on chromosome 7",
      "C": "Lithium exposure in utero",
      "D": "Maternal alcohol consumption"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The infant has a common form of congenital heart disease, a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The defect is characterized by a holosystolic murmur, which is best heard at the left lower sternal border. The murmur is caused by the abnormal flow of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. The American Heart Association estimates that VSD is the most common congenital heart defect, accounting for 40% of all cases. The defect is more common in females than in males. The incidence of VSD is increased in infants whose mothers have been exposed to lithium during pregnancy. The 22q11 deletion syndrome is also associated with VSD. The other conditions listed are not associated with VSD.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
