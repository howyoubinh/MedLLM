    "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she is embarrassed about the appearance of her nails. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She appears well. A photograph of the nails is shown. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces",
      "B": "Flesh-colored papules in the lumbosacral region",
      "C": "Erosions of the dental enamel",
      "D": "Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings shown in the photograph are those of nail pitting, which is characteristic of psoriasis. The most common form of psoriasis is chronic plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with a silvery scale. The extensor surfaces of the knees, elbows, and scalp are the most commonly affected areas. Flexural psoriasis, which is characterized by moist, red plaques in the intertriginous areas, is another common form of psoriasis. The third most common form is palmoplantar psoriasis, which is characterized by erythematous plaques with a silvery scale on the palms and soles. Nail involvement is seen in 50% of patients with psoriasis, and nail pitting is the most common finding. Oral findings include dental enamel erosions, which can lead to a decreased ability to maintain adequate oral hygiene. The other listed findings are not characteristic of psoriasis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
