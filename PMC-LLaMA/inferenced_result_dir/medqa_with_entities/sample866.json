    "question": "An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7°C (97.0°F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient’s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Insufficient production of procollagen type 1",
      "B": "Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1",
      "C": "Defective collagen type 3",
      "D": "Dysfunctional structure of laminins"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are most consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which is a genetic disorder characterized by defective synthesis of collagen type 1. It is a spectrum of disorders that can affect the skeletal, dental, and ocular systems. The most severe forms of OI are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy. Patients with mild forms may not be diagnosed until childhood or even adulthood. The defect in collagen type 1 results in poor bone mineralization and therefore, the bones are easily broken. The inheritance pattern is usually autosomal dominant, but there are cases of autosomal recessive and X-linked forms. The most common form of OI is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding for the pro-alpha1(1) chain of collagen type 1 (COL1A1). The COL1A1 gene is located on chromosome 17q21.31. The defect in collagen type 1 results in decreased tensile strength and increased brittleness of bone. Patients with OI have normal growth hormone levels and normal osteoblast and osteoclast function. The other choices are not consistent with the patient’s symptoms. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (choice B) cause Marfan syndrome. Defective collagen type 3 (choice C) causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Dysfunctional laminins (choice D) cause muscular dystrophy.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
