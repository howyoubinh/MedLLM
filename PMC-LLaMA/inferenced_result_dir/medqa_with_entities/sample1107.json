    "question": "A 76-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She has a history of hypertension well controlled with diet and exercise. She has no history of smoking or illicit drug use. She walks one mile daily. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. When compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased lung compliance",
      "B": "Decreased residual volume",
      "C": "Increased chest wall compliance",
      "D": "Decreased A-a gradient"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely change in respiratory function in the elderly compared to a healthy 20-year-old is decreased chest wall compliance. The other choices are incorrect: lung compliance decreases with age, but chest wall compliance is unchanged; residual volume increases with age, not decreases; the A-a gradient, which is a measure of diffusion capacity, is unchanged; and vital capacity decreases with age, but total lung capacity is unchanged.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
