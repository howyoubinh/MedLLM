    "question": "A 27-year-old male suddenly develops severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea. The patient reports consuming undercooked ground beef four days prior to the onset of the symptoms. Which of the following best describes the toxin-mediated mechanism of this disease process?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to mucosal cell death",
      "B": "Increased pH of gastrointestinal lumen resulting in reduced mucosal absorption",
      "C": "Increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, resulting in decreased absorption and increased secretion in the digestive tract",
      "D": "Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is suffering from food poisoning due to E.coli. The toxin responsible for this condition is called Shiga-like toxin. This toxin has 2 subunits: A1 and A2. The A1 subunit has the active site and binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. The A2 subunit assists in binding the toxin to the target cell. The clinical manifestations of this disease process are due to the inhibition of protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells. The other choices are incorrect. Depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to mucosal cell death (choice A) is the mechanism of action of the toxin produced by Clostridium difficile. Increased pH of gastrointestinal lumen resulting in reduced mucosal absorption (choice B) is the mechanism of action of the toxin produced by Vibrio cholerae. Increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, resulting in decreased absorption and increased secretion in the digestive tract (choice C) is the mechanism of action of the toxin produced by Vibrio parahaemolyticus.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
