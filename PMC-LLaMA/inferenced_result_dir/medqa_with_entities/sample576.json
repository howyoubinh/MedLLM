    "question": "A 32-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her friend for acute onset abdominal pain. She states that she was in a kickboxing class when she suddenly developed left-sided abdominal pain. Her past medical history is significant for chlamydia. She is currently sexually active and does not use contraception. Her menstrual periods occur regularly every 30 days. Her last menstrual period ended 2 days ago. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, there is left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic examination is notable for clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa. A pelvic ultrasound with Doppler reveals a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ectopic pregnancy",
      "B": "Ovarian torsion",
      "C": "Pelvic inflammatory disease",
      "D": "Ruptured ovarian cyst"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s presentation is most consistent with a ruptured ovarian cyst. Symptoms of a ruptured ovarian cyst include acute onset of abdominal pain, which may be associated with syncope. The risk of rupture is increased in larger cysts and in cysts with hemorrhagic contents. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, and treatment is supportive. In patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, the most common finding on pelvic exam is tenderness. However, in this case, there is no evidence of an adnexal mass or fullness. Ovarian torsion usually presents with acute onset of severe pelvic pain. The patient’s pelvic exam is only tender, which is not consistent with ovarian torsion. PID can present with lower abdominal pain and vaginal discharge, but the presence of a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch is not consistent with PID.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
