    "question": "An otherwise healthy 29-year-old man presents to his family physician with a slowly growing left neck mass for the past 5 weeks. He denies fever or recent upper respiratory tract infections. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), the blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg, and the pulse are 82/min. On examination, a 4-cm (1.5 in), firm, non-tender mass is detected on the mid-left neck. Excisional biopsy of the mass reveals Hodgkin’s cells. The patient is referred to the oncology department and chemotherapy is started. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient notices that his urine becomes red. The urine tests are positive for blood on further analysis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bleomycin",
      "B": "Cyclophosphamide",
      "C": "Doxorubicin",
      "D": "Etoposide"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is suffering from 'hemorrhagic cystitis' caused by 'cyclophosphamide'. Hemorrhagic cystitis is a well-known complication of 'cyclophosphamide'. It is attributed to the presence of its metabolite 'acrolein' in the urine. The risk of developing this adverse effect is greater in patients who are dehydrated or who receive intravenous cyclophosphamide. The incidence of this adverse effect can be reduced by aggressive hydration and by the use of 'mesna', a sulfhydryl compound that binds acrolein in the urine.\n\n'Bleomycin' and 'doxorubicin' can cause pulmonary fibrosis and 'etoposide' can cause alopecia and GI disturbances.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
