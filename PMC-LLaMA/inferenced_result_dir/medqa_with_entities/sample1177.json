    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents with an unsteady and broad-based gait, dysmetria, and intention tremor in the distal upper extremities. Her past medical history is relevant for depression, personality changes, and declining work performance, for which she has been put on leave from her current job as an elementary school teacher. On physical examination, patient has dysarthria, dystonia, and an ataxic gait. Ophthalmologic examination reveals multi-colored irises with concentric rings around the periphery (findings shown in the photo). Sensation and motor functions are preserved. Which of the following would you expect to be abnormally accumulated in this patient’s tissues?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Iron",
      "B": "Copper",
      "C": "Lead",
      "D": "Mercury"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical findings are most consistent with Wilsons’ disease (hepatolenticular degeneration), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal copper accumulation in tissues, particularly the liver and brain. The disease has a variable presentation, with hepatic involvement often preceding neurologic symptoms. Hepatic involvement leads to cirrhosis, hepatitis, or hepatic decompensation. Neurologic symptoms include dystonia, incoordination, tremor, and behavioral abnormalities. Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) are seen in the iris due to copper deposition in Descemet membrane in the eye. Diagnosis is made by the measurement of copper levels in the 24-hour urine sample.\n\nOption A: Iron overload can lead to cirrhosis, but the presentation is different.\nOption B: Copper accumulation can occur in Wilson’s disease, but it is not associated with the multi-colored iris findings.\nOption C: Lead poisoning can cause neurologic symptoms, but it is not associated with the multi-colored iris findings.\nOption D: Mercury poisoning can cause neurologic symptoms, but it is not associated with the multi-colored iris findings.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
