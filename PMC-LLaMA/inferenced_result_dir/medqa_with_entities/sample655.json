    "question": "A 62-year-old woman with a pancreatic insulinoma is being prepared for a laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor. After induction of general anesthesia, preparation of a sterile surgical field, and port placement, the surgeon needs to enter the space posterior to the stomach to access the pancreatic tumor. Which of the following ligaments must be cut in order to access this space?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Phrenoesophageal ligament",
      "B": "Gastrohepatic ligament",
      "C": "Phrenicocolic ligament",
      "D": "Ligamentum venosum"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The gastrohepatic ligament is the only ligament listed that is located posterior to the stomach. The phrenoesophageal ligament is located inferior to the esophagus and the phrenicocolic ligament is located at the inferior border of the colon. The ligamentum venosum is a ligament that is only present during fetal development and is not found in adults.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
