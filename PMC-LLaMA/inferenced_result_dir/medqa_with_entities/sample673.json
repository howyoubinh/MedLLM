    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 Î¼m3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Red blood cell transfusions",
      "B": "Gluten-free diet",
      "C": "Vitamin B12 injections",
      "D": "Folic acid supplementation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings described are characteristic of a megaloblastic anemia. The positive family history and the presence of mild scleral icterus suggest a diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease). The oral manifestations of this disease are the result of a deficiency of vitamin B12 , which is necessary for DNA synthesis in oral epithelium. In patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, vitamin B12 deficiency occurs secondary to a lack of intrinsic factor production by the diseased small intestine. A gluten-free diet would have prevented the development of this deficiency. A folic acid supplementation would not have prevented the oral findings because folate is not required for DNA synthesis in oral epithelium. A red blood cell transfusion would have corrected the anemia but would not have prevented the oral findings. Vitamin B12 injections would have prevented the oral findings because the vitamin B12 deficiency could have been corrected with supplementation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
