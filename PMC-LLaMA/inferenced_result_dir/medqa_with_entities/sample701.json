    "question": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to his primary care physician for a physical prior to beginning a preschool program. He is found to be delayed in reaching normal childhood cognitive and social milestones, which is consistent with observations at previous check-ups. Physically, he is also found to be significantly overweight with hypogonadism. Notably, the boy was limp when he was born and did not have a normal motor response to stimuli. Elevated levels of a gastrointestinal hormone are associated with the cause of this patient's weight gain. The hormone that is most responsible for causing the weight gain is produced in which of the following cell types?",
    "options": {
      "A": "D cells",
      "B": "G cells",
      "C": "P/D1 cells",
      "D": "L cells"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, which is associated with deletions or mutations of genes on chromosome 15. The characteristic features of this syndrome include diminished fetal activity, hypotonia, failure to thrive in infancy, short stature, small hands and feet, hypogonadism, and mental retardation. Obesity is a common feature of this syndrome, and is thought to be due to excessive release of gastric ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. D cells are found in the gastric mucosa and produce ghrelin. P/D1 cells are enterochromaffin-like cells that are found in the gastric mucosa and produce histamine. L cells are found in the intestinal mucosa and produce glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), which stimulates insulin release from the pancreas. K cells are enterochromaffin cells that produce serotonin and are found in the intestinal mucosa. E cells are pancreatic alpha cells that produce glucagon.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
