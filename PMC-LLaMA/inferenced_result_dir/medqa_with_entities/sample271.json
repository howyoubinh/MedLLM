    "question": "A 22-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. She is concerned about the results of a dipstick test she performed at home, which showed 1+ glucose. She does not know  if her liquid consumption has increased, but she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2 and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. The blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The lungs are clear to auscultation, the heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and there is no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness. The laboratory tests show the following results:\nFasting glucose 97 mg/L\nALT 12 IU/L\nAST 14 IU/L\nTotal bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL(15 µmol/L)\nPlasma creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (61.9 µmol/L)\nWhich of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?",
    "options": {
      "A": "HbA1c measurement",
      "B": "No tests required",
      "C": "Urinalysis",
      "D": "Oral glucose tolerance test"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s history and laboratory results are consistent with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017a) recommends screening for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks using a 1-hour 50-g oral glucose challenge test (GCT) with a loading dose of 50 g of glucose. If the GCT is positive (>140 mg/dL), then a 3-hour diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using a 100-g glucose load is performed. The HbA1c is not recommended for screening because it is less sensitive than the GCT. The dipstick test is not a reliable screening test for GDM because it does not differentiate between the different forms of glucose in the urine (glucose, ketones, and/or sugar alcohols). The urinalysis is not indicated because there are no clinical signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
