    "question": "A 62-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his wife who is concerned about the patient's frequent falls. Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced. He shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Accumulations of beta-pleated sheets",
      "B": "Atrophy of the caudate nucleus",
      "C": "Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein",
      "D": "Intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's clinical history is most consistent with Parkinson disease (PD). The combination of progressive gait disturbance, rigidity, and falls is typical for PD. Autopsy studies of patients with PD reveal loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and accumulations of beta-pleated sheets in the form of Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are single or multiple, intra-neuronal, eosinophilic, round inclusions that have a dense core surrounded by a pale halo. They are composed by alpha-synuclein and are seen in PD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and pure autonomic failure. The other choices are not typically seen in PD. Choice B, atrophy of the caudate nucleus, is seen in Huntington disease. Choice C, intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein, is seen in multiple system atrophy. Choice D, intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau, is seen in progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia. Choice E, Hirano bodies, is seen in Alzheimer disease. Diagnosis: Parkinson disease\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
