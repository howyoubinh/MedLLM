    "question": "Please refer to the summary above to answer this question\nThe authors of the study have decided to conduct a follow-up analysis on their data. They decide to stratify their results by CD4+T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). Which of the following explains for the difference observed between the two strata?\"",

They are also used to facilitate the performance of medical treatments and/or associated procedures (e.g., anesthesia, resuscitation, endoscopy) and for the general transport of chemicals, ancillary devices, and miscellaneous materials. Some carts may be used for the filing and transport of documents such as medical and/or administrative records and cards.
