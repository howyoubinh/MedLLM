    "question": "A one-week-old boy presents with yellow sclerae, severe lethargy, and decreased muscle tone. His mother notes that the symptoms started shortly after birth and have been progressively worsening. The patient is breast fed and takes no medications. His labs are within normal limits with the exception of his liver function tests as follows:\n\nALT: 8 U/ L\nAST: 10 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase: 50 U/L\nAlbumin: 3.7 g/dL\nTotal protein: 6.7 g/dL\nBilirubin, total: 29.4 mg/dL\nBilirubin, unconjugated: 29.2 mg/dL\nBilirubin, conjugated: 0.2 mg/dL\n\nThe boy is taken immediately for treatment. What is the most likely underlying cause of his condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1",
      "B": "Alteration in the ankyrin protein",
      "C": "Reduction in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 activity",
      "D": "Deficiency in glucocerebrosidase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is C. This patient's presentation is consistent with neonatal jaundice due to a deficiency in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 activity. This condition is known as Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I. The absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The other options are not related to bilirubin metabolism and are not associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
