His blood pressure is 115/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 65/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). The patient states that he has been having trouble chewing his food, but is not experiencing any pain. The patient is up to date on all of his immunizations. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his facial swelling?",

      "B": "Benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue",
      "C": "An infection with paramyxovirus",
      "D": "Malignant tumor composed of squamous and mucinous cells"
    }
