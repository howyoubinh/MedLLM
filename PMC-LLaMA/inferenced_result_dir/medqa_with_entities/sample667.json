    "question": "A 40-year-old patient is brought into the emergency department after suffering a motor vehicle crash where he was pinned underneath his motorcycle for about 30 minutes before a passerby called 911. While evaluating him per your institution's trauma guidelines, you discover pain upon palpation of his right lower extremity which is much larger than his left counterpart. The patient admits to decreased sensation over his right lower extremity and cannot move his leg. There are no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on this extremity, and it is colder and paler in comparison to his left side. Measured compartment pressure of his distal right leg is 35 mm Hg. What is the next best step in this patient's care?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Emergent fasciotomy",
      "B": "Venous doppler",
      "C": "Arteriogram",
      "D": "External fixation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has developed a compartment syndrome secondary to prolonged external compression. The first step in management should be to perform an emergent fasciotomy to relieve the pressure and restore perfusion to the affected limb. Delay can result in tissue necrosis and loss of limb. Venous doppler may be used to assess for deep venous thrombosis, but it will not address the immediate life-threatening issue of compartment syndrome. Arteriogram is not indicated as the pulses are absent, indicating a vascular injury, but it is not the most urgent step. External fixation may be used to stabilize fractures, but it does not address the compartment syndrome.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
