    "question": "A 58-year-old male is diagnosed with hypertension and started on daily propranolol after failing antihypertensive therapy with other medications. Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased bronchodilation",
      "B": "Increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract",
      "C": "Decreased heart rate",
      "D": "Increased heart rate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's blood pressure would be expected to increase upon administration of epinephrine. Epinephrine activates b1 -adrenergic receptors, which increase heart rate and contractility. Epinephrine also activates a1 -adrenergic receptors, which cause vasoconstriction and increase peripheral resistance, resulting in increased blood pressure. Epinephrine does not affect motility of the gastrointestinal tract, nor does it affect motility of the sperm. Bronchodilation is caused by activation of b2 -adrenergic receptors, which is not affected by epinephrine.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
