    "question": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to the left chest just below the clavicle. On arrival, he has rapid, shallow breathing and appears anxious. His pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. Five minutes later, his pulse is 133/min and blood pressure is 82/45 mm Hg. Examination shows no active external bleeding. There is a 2.5-cm single stab wound to the left chest at the 4th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiovascular examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
