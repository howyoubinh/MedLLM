    "question": "A one-week-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her daughter's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding exclusively and feels that he has been feeding well. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Phenobarbital administration",
      "B": "Plasma exchange",
      "C": "Switch from breast milk to formula",
      "D": "Continue normal breast feeding"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This is a case of physiologic jaundice. The child is presenting with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is a common condition in newborns. It occurs due to the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin and the initiation of red blood cell production. The liver is not yet capable of handling the increased load of bilirubin, and thus it accumulates in the tissues, causing the yellow color. The condition is usually mild and self-limiting, and resolves within the first 2 weeks of life. No treatment is necessary, and the mother should be reassured that her baby is normal. Breastfeeding should not be discontinued, as breast milk provides important immunologic protection for the infant. Phenobarbital administration, plasma exchange, and switching from breast milk to formula are unnecessary in this case.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
