    "question": "A 65-year-old man with a longstanding history of poorly-controlled hypertension and no recent illness or cardiac disease presents to clinic complaining of chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward. Vital signs are stable. On exam, you detect a friction rub. Routine labs show K 7.5 and Cr 5.1. If this patient's clinical signs and laboratory findings are indicative of a chronic condition, what would be expected on urinary analysis?",

  "model_response": "The presence of red blood cell casts in the urine suggests glomerular injury. The presence of muddy brown granular casts suggests interstitial injury or acute tubular necrosis. Fatty casts are seen in nephrotic syndrome. Broad and waxy casts are seen in chronic renal failure.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
