    "question": "A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night. Medications include atenolol and lisinopril. On physical exam, temperature is 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), blood pressure is 151/82 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 14/min. He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase. What is the next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Proceed with liver biopsy",
      "B": "Refer for surgical resection",
      "C": "Refer for radiofrequency ablation",
      "D": "Observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The next step in management is to observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months. This patient has a known history of alcoholic cirrhosis and a new 2 cm hepatic lobe lesion with arterial phase enhancement. Given the clinical scenario, the most likely diagnosis is hepatocellular carcinoma. The recommended approach is to observe the lesion with serial imaging studies, as the majority of these lesions are not aggressive. A liver biopsy would be required to confirm the diagnosis, but given the potential for sampling error and hemorrhage, it is not the best next step in management. Surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation are not appropriate initial steps in management for lesions that are likely to be hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
