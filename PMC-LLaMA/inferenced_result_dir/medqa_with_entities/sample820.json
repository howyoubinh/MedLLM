    "question": "A 68-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of worsening fatigue and weight loss. He is especially concerned about a recent episode in which he noticed a blurring of his vision and headache; he also notes that his “memory is not as good as it used to be,” which his wife confirms. Physical exam is notable only for pallor and general weakness. Laboratory studies reveal anemia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) reveals a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM; serum IgM concentration is 6.3 g/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?",
    "options": {
      "A": "IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)",
      "B": "Multiple myeloma",
      "C": "Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia",
      "D": "Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical picture is suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder, and the monoclonal gammopathy suggests a plasma cell dyscrasia. Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia is a neoplastic disorder of small lymphocytes that secrete IgM. The clinical features are related to the infiltration of various organs with tumor cells and the production of large amounts of IgM, which can cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. The other choices are not associated with hyperviscosity.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
