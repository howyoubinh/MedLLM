    "question": "A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperplasia",
      "B": "Hypertrophy",
      "C": "Atrophy",
      "D": "Metaplasia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The answer is A. Hyperplasia. The term hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue. In the case of the breast, the proliferation of the epithelial cells results in an increased number of acinar glands. The term hypertrophy refers to an increase in the size of cells, which results in an increase in the size of the organ or tissue. The term atrophy refers to a decrease in the size of cells, which results in a decrease in the size of the organ or tissue. The term metaplasia refers to a change in the type of cells present in an organ or tissue. None of these terms describe the change in the breast tissue during pregnancy.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
