    "question": "A 4-month-old infant is brought to the office by his parents due to sudden nose bleeding without trauma of any kind. He has a 1-month history of multiple bruising that measures 1 cm in diameter each in the hands and feet, and tiny red spots that appeared in the upper and lower extremities without any trauma either. He has no prior bleeding history nor any relevant family history. The vital signs include: heart rate 190/min, respiratory rate 40/min, blood pressure 99/42 mm Hg, and temperature 36.6 °C (97.9 °F). His physical exam shows pale skin color, petechiae in the soft palate and in the upper and lower extremities as well as ecchymosis in the back of the hands and feet.\nThe complete blood count results are as follows:\nHemoglobin 8.9 g/dL\nHematocrit 41%\nLeukocyte count 10,500/mm3\nNeutrophils 53%\nBands 2%\nEosinophils 1%\nBasophils 0%\nLymphocytes 33%\nMonocytes 2%\nPlatelet count 450,000/mm3\nThe coagulation test results are as follows:\nPartial thromboplastin time (activated) 30.0 sec\nProthrombin time 13.6 sec\nInternational normalized ratio 0.99\nFibrinogen 364.9 mg/dL\nThe blood smear shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets, while a platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. The overall bleeding time is increased. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Von Willebrand disease",
      "B": "Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia",
      "C": "Bernard-Soulier disease",
      "D": "Scurvy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s laboratory results show a platelet count of 450,000/mm3, which is normal, but the overall bleeding time is increased. The blood smear shows large platelets, and the platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex. This deficiency impairs platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor and impairs platelet aggregation. The platelet count is normal, but the overall function is decreased. The platelet morphology is normal, and the coagulation tests are normal. Von Willebrand disease is a deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which is a protein that mediates platelet adhesion to damaged endothelial surfaces. Patients with von Willebrand disease have a prolonged bleeding time and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time. Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex. This glycoprotein is a receptor for fibrinogen, and its deficiency impairs platelet aggregation. Patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia have a normal platelet count and a normal bleeding time, but they have a prolonged clotting time because of the impaired platelet aggregation. Scurvy is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C, which is required for collagen synthesis. Patients with scurvy have an increased bleeding tendency, but they have a normal platelet count and a normal bleeding time. They may have a prolonged clotting time because of the impaired platelet aggregation. The other options are not consistent with the patient’s laboratory results.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
