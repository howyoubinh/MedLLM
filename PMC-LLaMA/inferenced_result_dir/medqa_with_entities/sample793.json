    "question": "A 5-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician for evaluation of difficulties noted at school. Her kindergarten teacher voiced her concern that the child ‘spaces out’ often and thinks she may have ADHD. The parents deny any history of head trauma or infection. Her blood pressure is 106/74 mm Hg, the heart rate is 69/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical exam demonstrates a happy child who has reached developmental milestones. Laboratory results are within normal limits. EEG demonstrates a 3-Hz spike and wave pattern (see image). The decision is made to start the child on medical therapy. What should be advised to the parents as a potential side effect of the first-line medication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Nystagmus",
      "B": "GI upset",
      "C": "Facial rash and blood in the urine",
      "D": "Weight gain and change in hair color"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. GI upset. The child is suffering from absence seizures, which are typified by the EEG finding of 3-Hz spike and wave pattern. The first-line medication for absence seizures is ethosuximide, which works by reducing low-frequency calcium currents in the thalamic neurons. Ethosuximide has a narrow therapeutic index and requires slow titration. The most common side effect is GI upset. The other listed side effects are not associated with ethosuximide.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
