    "question": "A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?",
    "options": {
      "A": "9/100",
      "B": "1/10",
      "C": "81/100",

    }

  "model_response": "The correct answer is D: 9/10. This is a question about population genetics and the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The Hardy-Weinberg equation states that the frequency of an allele (in a population) will remain constant unless specific conditions are present that cause a change in that frequency. In this case, the disease frequency in the general population is 1/100, but the female in question has the disease because she carries two copies of the mutant allele (one from each parent). The frequency of this disease allele will be 1/50 in her children (one in two) because each child will be a carrier like their mother. The frequency of this allele in the general population is 1/100, so the frequency of this allele in the child's father will be 1/100 (one in a hundred). The frequency of this allele in the general population is 1/100, so the frequency of this allele in the child's mother will be 1/50 (one in two). The frequency of this allele in the general population is 1/100, so the frequency of this allele in the child's father will be 1/100 (one in a hundred).
