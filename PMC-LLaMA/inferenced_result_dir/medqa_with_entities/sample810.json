    "question": "An otherwise healthy 49-year-old woman has a routine full blood count complete prior her elective cholecystectomy. The lab test results are as follows:\nLaboratory test\nHemoglobin\n12.1 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV)\n85 μm3\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)\n47%\nReticulocyte count\n3.4 %\nWhite blood cell count\n9700/mm3\nPlatelet count\n229,000/mm3\nA peripheral blood smear reveals spherocytes. The Coombs test is negative. The physical examination is remarkable for scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic test of this patient’s underlying disorder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Eosin-5-maleimide binding test",
      "B": "Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59",
      "C": "Anti parvovirus B19 antibodies",
      "D": "Liver function tests"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of icterus and moderate splenomegaly suggests that the patient has hemolytic anemia. The negative Coombs test indicates that the hemolysis is due to an autoimmune mechanism. The presence of spherocytes suggests that the hemolysis is due to an underlying immune-mediated process. The most common cause of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in adults is the presence of cold agglutinin antibodies, which are anti-I antibodies that bind red cells avidly at low temperatures. These antibodies cause lysis of red cells in vascular beds exposed to low temperatures, such as the hands and feet. This type of hemolysis is seen in association with infections, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as with malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The eosin-5-maleimide binding test is used to detect the presence of cold agglutinin antibodies. Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 is used to detect the presence of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Anti parvovirus B19 antibodies are used to detect the presence of parvovirus B19 infection, which can cause aplastic crisis. Liver function tests are used to detect the presence of liver disease, which can cause a hemolytic anemia.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
