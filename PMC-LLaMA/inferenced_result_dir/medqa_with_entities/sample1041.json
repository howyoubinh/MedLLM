    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for evaluation because his parents have been concerned by a number of troubling signs. Specifically, they have noticed that he has been exhibiting aggressive behavior as well as hyperactivity. In addition, he has had intellectual disability and is slow to hit developmental milestones. Physical exam reveals coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness. Eye exam reveals no abnormalities of the cornea or lens. Based on these findings, the patient is referred to a geneticist for further evaluation. Which of the following substances would most likely accumulate in the cells of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cerebroside sulfate",
      "B": "Galactocerebroside",
      "C": "Heparan sulfate",
      "D": "Sphingomyelin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is displaying the symptoms of Hurler syndrome, which is a lysosomal storage disease. In this disorder, the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase is deficient, which leads to the accumulation of heparan sulfate in the cells. The accumulation of cerebroside sulfate occurs in Krabbe disease, which is a different lysosomal storage disease. The accumulation of galactocerebroside occurs in both Krabbe disease and globoid cell leukodystrophy. The accumulation of heparin occurs in heparin storage disease, which is a different lysosomal storage disease. The accumulation of sphingomyelin occurs in Niemann-Pick disease, which is a different lysosomal storage disease.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
