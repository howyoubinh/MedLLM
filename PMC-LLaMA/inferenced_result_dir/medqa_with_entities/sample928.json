    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, wheezing, and palpitations. His symptoms began approx. 20 minutes after being stung by a bee on the left arm. Past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he takes labetalol. While being questioned, the patient becomes obtunded. His vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F); blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respiratory rate 31/min; and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. On physical examination, an area of severe edema and erythema is noted on the extensor surface of the left forearm, and there is severe angioedema of the face and neck. The patient is intubated, and aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine are administered. A repeat blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg, despite these efforts. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer dopamine",
      "B": "Administer glucagon",
      "C": "Administer dexamethasone",
      "D": "Administer norepinephrine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis can cause hypotension and shock. The initial treatment includes administration of intramuscular epinephrine. If the patient remains hypotensive, then norepinephrine should be administered. Glucagon has a positive inotropic effect and may be used in place of epinephrine in patients taking beta-blockers. Dopamine and dexamethasone are not indicated in the treatment of anaphylaxis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
