    "question": "A 63-year-old man with diverticular disease comes to the emergency department because of painless rectal bleeding, dizziness, and lightheadedness for 2 hours. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.6°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 86/60 mm Hg. He appears pale. Physical examination shows bright red rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy shows profuse diverticular bleeding; endoscopic hemostasis is performed. After initiating fluid resuscitation, the patient becomes hemodynamically stable. The following day, laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 8 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 15,500/mm3\nPlatelet count 170,000/mm3\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 60 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2.1 mg/dL\nBilirubin\nTotal 1.2 mg/dL\nIndirect 0.3 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 96 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT, GPT) 2,674 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST, GOT) 2,254 U/L\nWhich of the following cells in the patient's liver were most likely damaged first?\"",

The most likely sequence of events is that hemorrhage led to hypotension, which led to decreased renal blood flow and acute tubular necrosis.
