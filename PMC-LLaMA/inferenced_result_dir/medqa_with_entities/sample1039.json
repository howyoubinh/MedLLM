    "question": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 months. She wakes up frequently during the night and gets up earlier than desired. She experiences discomfort in her legs when lying down at night and feels the urge to move her legs. The discomfort resolves when she gets up and walks around or moves her legs. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amitryptiline",
      "B": "Pramipexole",
      "C": "Codeine",
      "D": "Escitalopram"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's symptoms are suggestive of restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS is a neurologic disorder characterized by an uncomfortable sensation in the legs and an urge to move them. The symptoms typically begin or worsen with rest and are relieved by movement. RLS can be primary or secondary to other conditions, such as iron deficiency. The diagnosis of RLS is based on the patient's history and clinical examination. No specific laboratory studies are confirmatory. Treatment of RLS includes non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Non-pharmacologic therapies include avoiding caffeine and alcohol, massaging the legs, and stretching the muscles. Pharmacologic therapies include dopamine agonists such as pramipexole and ropinirole. Other medications that can be used are benzodiazepines, gabapentin, and opiates. Amitriptyline and codeine are not typically used for RLS. Escitalopram is an antidepressant that is not indicated for RLS.\n\n###COMMENT: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
