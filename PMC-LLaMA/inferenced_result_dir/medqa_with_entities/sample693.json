    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician’s clinic for recurrent episodes of chest pain that wakes her from her sleep. While usually occurring late at night, she has also had similar pains during the day at random times, most recently while sitting at her desk in her office and at other times while doing the dishes at home. The pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be effective in reducing her symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Aspirin",
      "B": "Isosorbide dinitrate",
      "C": "Heparin",
      "D": "Propranolol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are suggestive of angina pectoris. The random nature of the pain, its occurrence at rest, and its duration (10–15 minutes) are all consistent with this diagnosis. The most appropriate treatment for this patient is a medication that relaxes vascular smooth muscle and reduces cardiac preload, such as a nitrate. Nitrates dilate veins more than arteries, thereby decreasing preload. Isosorbide dinitrate is a short-acting nitrate that can be taken sublingually at the onset of chest pain. Aspirin is used for its antiplatelet effects, which reduce the incidence of MI. Heparin is used in the acute management of some coronary syndromes, but it is not appropriate for chronic therapy. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist that is useful in the treatment of hypertension and some arrhythmias, but it is not indicated for the treatment of angina pectoris. Atropine is a medication used to increase sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) conduction and to reverse some bradycardiac states. It is not indicated for angina.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
