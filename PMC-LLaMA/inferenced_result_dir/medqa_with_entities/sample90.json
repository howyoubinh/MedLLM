    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. She immigrated to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Undercooked pork meat",
      "B": "Undercooked fish meat",
      "C": "Dog feces",
      "D": "Freshwater snails"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has schistosomiasis, which is endemic in Uganda. The eggs released by the adult worms that live in the portal venous system induce a granulomatous inflammatory response that leads to portal fibrosis and, in some cases, portal hypertension. Undercooked pork meat can harbor the eggs of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium , which can cause a similar granulomatous inflammation. Undercooked fish meat can harbor the eggs of the fish tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum , which can cause vitamin B12 deficiency. Dog feces can harbor the eggs of Toxocara canis , which can cause visceral larva migrans. Freshwater snails are the intermediate hosts for Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni .\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
