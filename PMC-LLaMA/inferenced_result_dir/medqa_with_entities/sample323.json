    "question": "A 16-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a regular check-up. His mother says that he has not yet begun to walk. He is exclusively breastfed. He is at the 20th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 50th percentile for head circumference. Physical examination shows erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars. He has frontal bossing. His wrists are widened, his legs appear bowed, and there is beading of the ribs. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Deficiency of cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase",
      "B": "Defect in type I collagen",
      "C": "Impaired growth plate mineralization",
      "D": "Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The child has rickets, which is characterized by failure of mineralization in the growth plate, and in the bone deformities such as bowed legs and frontal bossing. The defect in type I collagen is osteogenesis imperfecta. Impaired growth plate mineralization is seen in hypophosphatasia. Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 is seen in achondroplasia. Deficiency of cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase is seen in osteoporosis pseudoglioma.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
