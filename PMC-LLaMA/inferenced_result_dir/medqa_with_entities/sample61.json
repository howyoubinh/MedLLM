At a party shortly afterward she experiences facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps after consuming alcohol. Serum levels of which of the following are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption:",

    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol. The most likely explanation is that the metronidazole she received for trichomoniasis was oxidized by cytochrome P-450 to an active oxidizing agent that inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that metabolizes ethanol. The accumulation of acetaldehyde is responsible for the symptoms of the disulfiram-like reaction.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
