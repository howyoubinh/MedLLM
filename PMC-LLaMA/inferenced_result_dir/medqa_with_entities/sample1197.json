    "question": "A 56-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of nausea and shortness of breath that started while he was at work one hour ago. He also reports lightheadedness that started earlier in the day. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes metformin and sitagliptin. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He appears pale and diaphoretic. A 12-lead ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Viral myocarditis",
      "B": "Acute pericarditis",
      "C": "Acute inferior myocardial infarction",
      "D": "Saddle pulmonary embolus"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The rhythm is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75/min. There is ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, with reciprocal ST-segment depression in leads I and aVL. This is diagnostic of acute inferior myocardial infarction. The patient's symptoms of nausea, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath are consistent with acute coronary syndrome. The ST-segment depression in leads I and aVL suggests occlusion of the left circumflex artery. The patient's risk factors include type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, and possibly metformin, which may be associated with lactic acidosis. The patient should be treated with aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine. He should be taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for angiography and possible revascularization.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
