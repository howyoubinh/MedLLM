    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin. One week ago, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl and his mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell. A Coombs test is negative. A peripheral blood smear is shown. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acute myelogenous leukemia",
      "B": "Cholecystitis",
      "C": "Renal papillary necrosis",
      "D": "Splenic sequestration crisis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical and laboratory picture is most consistent with sickle cell anemia. The patient is at greatest risk for the development of acute painful episodes due to sickling. Acute myelogenous leukemia is unlikely in this patient because of the prolonged history of anemia and the markedly increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. Cholecystitis is unlikely in this patient because of the absence of signs and symptoms of gallbladder inflammation. Renal papillary necrosis is unlikely in this patient because of the absence of signs and symptoms of urinary tract obstruction. Splenic sequestration crisis is unlikely in this patient because of the presence of a palpable spleen tip.\n\nThe peripheral blood smear shows numerous sickle cells, some of which are crescent shaped.\n\nSickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a point mutation in the b-globin gene, resulting in the replacement of a glutamate residue with a valine residue in the sixth position of the b-globin chain. The abnormal physiochemical properties of the resulting sickle hemoglobin (HbS) are responsible for the disease. In deoxygenated conditions, the HbS molecules polymerize, forming a gelatinous network of fibrous polymers that stiffen the erythrocyte membrane, increase viscosity, and cause dehydration due to potas- sium leakage and calcium influx. The dehydrated, rigid erythrocyte becomes an abnormal sickle shape that gives the disease its name. Sickled erythrocytes are prone to hemolysis and are trapped in small blood vessels, causing microvascular occlusion and ischemic damage. The ischemia-reperfusion cycle ultimately leads to chronic inflammation, increased oxidative stress, and premature cell death.\n\nThe most common clinical manifestation of sickle cell anemia is vaso-occlusive crisis, which causes severe pain as the result of ischemia in the bones, spleen, liver, brain, and lungs. The most common manifestation of sickle cell anemia in children is hand-foot syndrome, which is caused by infarction of bones in the hands and feet. The most common manifestation of sickle cell anemia in adults is painful episodes due to sickling. Other common manifestations include an increased susceptibility to infection, splenic sequestration crisis, aplastic crisis, and hemolytic anemia. Acute myelogenous leukemia is a rare complication of sickle cell anemia.\n\nThe diagnosis of sickle cell anemia is made by the demonstration of sickle cells on the peripheral blood smear. Sickle cells are crescent shaped, or sickle shaped, as a result of the formation of polymerized hemoglobin. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is increased due to the presence of irreversibly sickled HbS.\n\nThe treatment of sickle cell anemia is supportive. Patients should be referred to a hematologist for confirmation of the diagnosis and appropriate counseling regarding genetic counseling, the risk of infection, and the potential for acute painful episodes due to sickling. Patients with sickle cell anemia should be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, and H. influenzae type b. Patients who develop an acute painful episode due to sickling should be treated with a parenteral opioid analgesic agent, such as morphine, and oxygen. Patients with splenic sequestration crisis should be treated with emergency transfusion of washed packed red blood cells.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
