    "question": "A 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal examination. Her previous pregnancy was uncomplicated and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Her blood group is A, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. Administration of which of the following is most appropriate at this time?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Anti-A IgG",
      "B": "Anti-D IgG",
      "C": "Anti-B IgG",
      "D": "Anti-D IgM"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is Rh-negative and her fetus is Rh-positive. Therefore, there is a potential for Rh incompatibility and the development of Rh antibodies in the mother. Administration of anti-D IgG at 28 weeks' gestation decreases the risk of maternal sensitization. If the mother is exposed to fetal red blood cells at delivery or by trauma, administration of anti-D IgG within 72 hours will decrease the risk of a secondary immune response and prevent the development of antibodies. Anti-A IgG would be given if the mother was Rh-negative and A-positive. Anti-B IgG would be given if the mother was Rh-negative and B-positive. Anti-D IgM would be given if the mother was Rh-negative and D-positive.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
