    "question": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game. During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front. He was unable to stand up after this collision and reported severe knee pain. On presentation, he was found to have a mild knee effusion. Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle",
      "B": "Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle",
      "C": "Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle",
      "D": "Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The popliteus muscle runs from the lateral femoral condyle to the posterior surface of the tibia. It inserts on the posterior surface of the tibia, and its function is to unlock the knee joint by lateral rotation of the femur on the tibia prior to extension. This muscle is innervated by the tibial nerve. The structure that is damaged in this patient is the ligament that runs from the medial femoral condyle to the medial tibia. This ligament is called the medial collateral ligament (MCL). The anterior cruciate ligament runs from the medial femoral condyle to the anterior surface of the tibia. It is tensed in extension and prevents anterior displacement of the tibia on the femur. The anterior cruciate ligament is innervated by the tibial nerve. The lateral collateral ligament runs from the lateral femoral condyle to the head of the fibula. It prevents posterior displacement of the tibia on the femur. The lateral collateral ligament is innervated by the common peroneal nerve. The iliotibial band runs from the iliac crest to Gerdy's tubercle on the tibia. It is a thick band of fascia and is not attached to the knee joint.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
