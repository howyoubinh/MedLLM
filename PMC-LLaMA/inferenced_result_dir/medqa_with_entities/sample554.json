    "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a recent episode of chest pain. She says she was previously well and denies any history of similar symptoms. She reports that, at onset, she felt as if she was going to die and says her heart beating has been beating really fast. There was also profuse sweating, and she says she feels short of breath. She could not recall how long the event lasted but can remember that the symptoms did go away on their own by the time she arrived at the emergency department. Her vitals rapidly returned to normal while giving her medical history and she begins to look and act more calm. No significant past medical history or current medications.  Physical examination is unremarkable. Her electrocardiogram and initial cardiac enzymes are normal. Which the following is necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "1 month of associated symptoms ",
      "B": "Disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions",
      "C": "Family history",
      "D": "Agoraphobia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are suggestive of panic attacks. Panic attacks are defined as discrete episodes of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 or more of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, (2) sweating, (3) trembling or shaking, (4) shortness of breath or smothering sensation, (5) feeling of choking, (6) chest pain or discomfort, (7) nausea or abdominal distress, (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint, (9) derealization or depersonalization, (10) fear of losing control or going crazy, (11) fear of dying, and (12) paresthesias. The attacks are often associated with a fear of open spaces or crowds. The attacks are usually triggered by a specific situation or object. The patient should have at least 1 month of associated symptoms. The disruptive events should last > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions. Family history of panic disorder is a risk factor. Agoraphobia is a common comorbid condition.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
