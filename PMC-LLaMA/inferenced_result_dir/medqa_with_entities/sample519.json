    "question": "A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after being involved in a shooting. He sustained a gunshot wound in an altercation outside of a bar. On arrival, he is oriented to person but not to place or time. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 79/42 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows multiple abrasions over the arms and thorax. There is a 1-cm (0.4-in) entry wound with minimal bleeding on the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium; assessment of the abdomen is equivocal. An x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe. Two large-bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The patient is then taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
