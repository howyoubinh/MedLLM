    "question": "The first 24 hours after delivery, a 2888 g (6.37 lb) male newborn is not feeding well, has a high-pitched cry, and is diaphoretic. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated labor and delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within normal limits. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment of this newborn?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Oral morphine therapy",
      "B": "Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy",
      "C": "Oral methimazole therapy",
      "D": "Dextrose infusion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical findings suggest that the infant has neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The incidence of NAS increases with the frequency and timing of maternal drug use. In this case, the infant's symptoms are consistent with opioid withdrawal. The treatment of NAS involves careful monitoring, supportive care, and often pharmacologic treatment. The mainstay of treatment is a long-acting opioid, such as oral morphine therapy. An intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy would be indicated if there were signs of sepsis. Oral methimazole therapy is used in infants with congenital hypothyroidism. Dextrose infusion would be indicated if the infant were hypoglycemic, which is not the case here.\n\n### COMMENTS: NAS may be seen in infants exposed to methadone, alcohol, barbiturates, cocaine, and tricyclic antidepressants. NAS is not seen in infants exposed to PCP. NAS symptoms may be seen as early as 24 hours after birth, but the syndrome usually appears between days 2 and 3 of life. The symptoms may persist for 1 to 2 weeks. Hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response are all characteristic of opioid withdrawal. The symptoms are self-limited and remit by 1 week. The treatment of NAS involves careful monitoring, supportive care, and often pharmacologic treatment. The mainstay of treatment is a long-acting opioid, such as oral morphine therapy. The dose is titrated to control the signs and symptoms of withdrawal. The dose of oral morphine is gradually reduced over 1 to 2 weeks. Clonidine, a short-acting opioid, may also be used. Intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement are important components of care. Phenobarbital has been used in treating NAS, but is not a first-line therapy.</s><s>",
