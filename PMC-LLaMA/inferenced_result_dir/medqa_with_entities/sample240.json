    "question": "A 46-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of a cough for 6 months. He has been taking over-the-counter cough medications, but they have not helped much. He adds that he expectorated bloody sputum the previous night. He denies breathlessness but mentions that he frequently experiences fatigue after little physical exertion. There is no past history of any specific medical disorder. His father died of lung cancer at the age of 54 years. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse rate is 82/min, the blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 18/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals the presence of localized rhonchi over the interscapular region. A plain radiograph of the chest shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung. Further diagnostic evaluation confirms the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung. If his blood were to be sent for laboratory evaluation, which of the following proteins is most likely to be elevated in his serum?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bence-Jones protein",
      "B": "Calcitonin",
      "C": "CA 15-3",
      "D": "Neuron-specific enolase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of a cough with bloody sputum, coupled with the finding of localized rhonchi on auscultation, suggests that the patient has a lung cancer. The presence of clubbing suggests that the cancer is located peripherally. The presence of a coin-like opacity in the right lung on the chest radiograph suggests that the cancer is a small cell carcinoma. Small cell carcinomas are frequently hilar or central in location. They are highly associated with cigarette smoking. These tumors are frequently hormone-producing, and so the serum level of calcitonin, a hormone normally produced by the thyroid gland, may be elevated. Bence-Jones proteins are light chains of immunoglobulins and are seen in multiple myeloma. CA 15-3 is a tumor marker for breast cancer. Neuron-specific enolase is an enzyme that is elevated in small cell lung cancer and neuroblastoma. Neuron-specific enolase is also elevated in the presence of some non-small cell lung cancers.
