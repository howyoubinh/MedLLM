    "question": "A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of genital lesions. She has no history of serious illness. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows multiple hyperkeratotic exophytic papules over the vulva. The lesions turn white on application of 3% acetic acid. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Condoms",
      "B": "Anti-HIV prophylaxis",
      "C": "Spermicidal foam",
      "D": "Vaccination"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has condylomata acuminata, a sexually transmitted disease. The causative organism is human papillomavirus (HPV), which may be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact with infected genital skin or mucosa. The incubation period is 3-4 months. The lesions may be seen with the naked eye, but a magnified examination with a colposcope is often necessary. The lesions are hyperkeratotic papules that may coalesce to form large cauliflower-like growths. The lesions turn white with the application of 3% acetic acid, which \"burns off\" the excess keratin. The application of 5% acetic acid to cervical epithelium infected with HPV causes the epithelium to \"melt\" (acetowhite). HPV types 6 and 11 are usually associated with external genital warts. HPV types 16 and 18 are usually associated with cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer. The diagnosis of HPV infection is made by DNA hybridization with typespecific probes. Condoms can prevent the spread of HPV, but they are not 100% effective because they may fail (break or slip off) or may not cover the external genital warts. Anti-HIV prophylaxis does not prevent HPV infection. Spermicidal foam may prevent infection by killing sperm, but it will not prevent HPV infection. Vaccination with the recombinant HPV vaccine prevents infection with HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
