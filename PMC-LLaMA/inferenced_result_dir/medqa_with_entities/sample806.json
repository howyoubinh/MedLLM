    "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents to the physician because of ongoing diarrhea for the past 1 month. She reports that diarrhea has been intermittently present for the past month. The stool is often loose and associated with blood and lower abdominal pain. She denies any recent travel history, and she works at a nursing home as a caretaker. She is not currently on any medications. Clinical examination shows mild tenderness in the suprapubic region, and there is no organomegaly. Findings on colonoscopy include patchy erythema and ulceration in the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Mucosal biopsy shows colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Crohnâ€™s disease",
      "B": "Acute infective colitis",
      "C": "Pseudomembranous colitis",
      "D": "Irritable bowel syndrome"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical and histologic features are consistent with acute infective colitis. The most common infectious agents that cause acute infective colitis are bacterial, including Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli. These infections are usually associated with bloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is made by documenting the presence of fecal leukocytes, as well as by the history of diarrhea. The other choices are not associated with fecal leukocytes.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
