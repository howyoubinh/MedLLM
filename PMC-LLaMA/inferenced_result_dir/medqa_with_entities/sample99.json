    "question": "A 43-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, currently controlled with medication, comes in for an appointment with his internist. He is concerned about abnormal discharge from both nipples over the past 3 months. The fluid is white, and he wonders if it could be milk. On further review of systems, he endorses a diminished sexual drive. The physician suspects that one of the patient's medications may be the culprit for these symptoms. Which of the following medications is NOT likely to be the cause?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Haloperidol",
      "B": "Bromocriptine",
      "C": "Fluphenazine",
      "D": "Risperidone"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are likely due to hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by medications that increase prolactin (dopamine antagonists) or decrease dopamine synthesis (dopamine depleters). The only medication in the list that does not cause hyperprolactinemia is risperidone. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is more likely to cause hyperlipidemia and weight gain than the other medications.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
