    "question": "A 60-year-old man is referred to a dermatologist by his family physician for management of a rare case of dermatitis that has not responded to standard therapy with corticosteroids. The patient’s medical history is unremarkable, and he is currently working reduced hours at his job as an accountant. Physical examination reveals confluent scaly patches, plaques, and generalized erythroderma along the torso and lower extremities (see image). There is also a solid skin lesion with a diameter greater than 1 cm. The dermatologist suspects a malignancy and orders a biopsy. Which of the following is the most accurate description of this condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Vascular tumor containing spindle cells",
      "B": "Tumor arising from the folliculosebaceous–apocrine germ",
      "C": "Tumor arising from cutaneous T cells",
      "D": "Tumor arising from epidermal keratinocytes"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a malignant tumor of epidermal keratinocytes, also known as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This is the second most common form of skin cancer, and it is strongly associated with cumulative exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The incidence of SCC also increases with age, and it is more common in men than in women. The most common predisposing factor is exposure to UV radiation, especially in fair-skinned people. Other predisposing factors include chemical carcinogens (arsenicals, tar, and oils), chronic inflammation, and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. The diagnosis is established by biopsy, and the prognosis depends on the tumor’s depth of invasion. Superficial SCCs are confined to the epidermis and have an excellent prognosis. In contrast, invasive SCCs extend into the dermis and have a much poorer prognosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
