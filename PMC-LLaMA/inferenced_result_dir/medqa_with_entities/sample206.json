    "question": "Researchers are studying the inheritance pattern of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. It is believed that, in addition to the commonly found ΔF508 mutation, a novel mutation in this gene is found in a particular population under study. Which of the following would most likely suggest that these two loci have a high probability of being closely linked?",
    "options": {
      "A": "LOD Score < 1",
      "B": "LOD Score < 2",
      "C": "LOD Score > 3",

    }
  },
  "model_response": "The LOD score is a statistical measure of whether two genetic markers are likely to be linked on the same chromosome. The farther apart two markers are, on average, the higher the likelihood that they will be separated on different chromosomes. The LOD score is calculated by comparing the probability of two markers being linked at the observed recombination frequency with the probability that they are unlinked. The LOD score is calculated as follows: LOD = (observed recombination frequency) / (probability of no recombination), where the probability of no recombination is the Hardy-Weinberg value. The value of the LOD score ranges from 0 to 1 (or -log10 [probability] to 0). A LOD score of 3 or higher is generally accepted as strong evidence that two markers are linked on the same chromosome. A value of 2 is considered suggestive, while a value of 1 is just above the random chance linkage expectation. A value of 0 means that the markers are not linked.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
