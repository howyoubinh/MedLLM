    "question": "A 24-year-old man is brought in to the emergency department by his parents who found him in his room barely responsive and with slurring speech. The patients’ parents say that a bottle of oxycodone was found at his bedside and was missing 15 pills. On physical examination, the patient appears drowsy and lethargic and is minimally responsive to stimuli. His respiratory rate is 8/min and shallow, blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 60/min. On physical examination, miosis is present, and the pupils appear pinpoint. The patient is given a drug to improve his symptoms. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely administered?",
    "options": {
      "A": "μ, κ, and ẟ receptor antagonist",
      "B": "μ receptor agonist",
      "C": "к receptor agonist and μ receptor antagonist",
      "D": "μ receptor partial agonist and к receptor agonist"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'A': 'Naloxone', 'B': 'Naltrexone', 'C': 'Buprenorphine', 'D': 'Butorphanol'}[?]Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces the agonist from opioid receptors, thereby reversing the effects of the agonist. It is the treatment of choice for opioid overdose. Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid antagonist that can be used as therapy for opioid dependence. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the μ receptor and antagonist of the к receptor. It is used as therapy for opioid dependence. Butorphanol is an agonist of the μ receptor and antagonist of the к receptor. It is used as an analgesic.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
