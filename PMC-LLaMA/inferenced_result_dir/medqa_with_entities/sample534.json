    "question": "A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for sudden onset of difficulty breathing 6 hours ago. For the past several months, he has had shortness of breath on exertion and while lying down on the bed, frequent headaches, and swelling of his feet. He does not take any medications despite being diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. His pulse is 90/min, respirations are 20/min, blood pressure is 150/110 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination shows an overweight male in acute distress with audible wheezes. Crackles are heard bilaterally and are loudest at the lung bases. Which of the following findings on cardiac auscultation will most likely be present in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Loud P2",
      "B": "S3 gallop",
      "C": "Absent S4",
      "D": "A loud S1"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The most likely cause of CHF in this patient is systolic hypertension, which has led to left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. The increased left ventricular stiffness and impaired relaxation result in a loud S1. The early diastolic sound (S2) is usually accentuated in patients with hypertension. The presence of rales suggests pulmonary edema. The S3 gallop is heard in association with an S4 gallop in patients with CHF.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
