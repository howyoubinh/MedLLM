    "question": "A 24-year-old married woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain since last night. She also complains of scant vaginal bleeding. She says she visited a physician last year who said she had a pelvic infection, but she was never treated because of insurance issues. She also says her period has been delayed this month. She is afebrile. The pulse is 124/min and the blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. On examination, her abdomen is distended and tender. A pregnancy test was positive. A complication of infection with which of the following organisms most likely led to this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Candida albicans",
      "B": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae",
      "C": "Chlamydia trachomatis",
      "D": "Haemophilus influenzae"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The positive pregnancy test rules out Candida albicans and Haemophilus influenzae. The patient’s symptoms are most likely due to a sexually transmitted infection. The most common cause of tubo-ovarian abscess is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and can lead to tubal scarring and adhesions, which can result in infertility or ectopic pregnancy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
