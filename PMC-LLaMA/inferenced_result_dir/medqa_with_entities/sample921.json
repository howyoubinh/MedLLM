    "question": "A 65-year-old female patient comes to the physician’s office for her annual check-up. The patient’s only complaint is that she feels her vision has been getting more blurry over the past year. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes diagnosed 20 years ago and osteoarthritis. Her medications include metformin, glimepiride, and ibuprofen as needed for pain. Fundoscopic examination of this patient reveals narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms. This patient’s symptoms are likely caused by tissue specific differences in expression of which of the following enzymes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sorbitol dehydrogenase",
      "B": "Galactocerebrosidase",
      "C": "Arylsulfatase A",
      "D": "Sphingomyelinase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is showing signs of diabetic retinopathy. The pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy involves the increased production of sorbitol by the polyol pathway. Glucose is conveed to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol is then conveed to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. In diabetics, levels of glucose are elevated, leading to an increase in sorbitol production. Sorbitol is not easily cleared from the tissues and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Excess sorbitol accumulates in the lens and retina, resulting in tissue damage. The other enzymes listed are involved in lysosomal storage diseases. These diseases are characterized by a deficiency of a lysosomal hydrolase and the accumulation of its substrate.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
