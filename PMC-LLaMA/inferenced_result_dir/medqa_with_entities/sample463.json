    "question": "A 65-year-old man, known to have chronic obstructive lung disease for the last 3 years, presents to the emergency department with a cough, breathing difficulty, and increased expectoration for a day. There is no history of fever. His regular medications include inhaled salmeterol and inhaled fluticasone propionate. He was a chronic smoker but quit smoking 2 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), the pulse rate is 88/min, the blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg, and the respirations are 30/min. On physical examination, the use of the accessory muscles of respiration is evident and the arterial saturation of oxygen is 87%. Auscultation of the chest reveals the presence of bilateral rhonchi with diminished breath sounds in both lungs. Which of the following medications, if administered for the next 2 weeks, is most likely to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Oral prednisone",
      "B": "Supplemental oxygen",
      "C": "Montelukast",
      "D": "Nebulized N-acetylcysteine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is presenting with an acute exacerbation of COPD. The use of oral prednisone for 2 weeks is associated with a reduction in the number of subsequent exacerbations over a 6-month period. Supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with resting hypoxemia (oxygen saturation < 89%). The use of inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) and inhaled beta-agonists (salmeterol) is a common form of maintenance therapy for COPD. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine is of no benefit in acute exacerbations of COPD. Theophylline is not recommended as a first-line therapy for COPD.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

The binding at the exosite allows the active portion of the molecule to remain at the receptor site and continually engage and disengage with the receptor, therefore providing a long duration of action. This agent stimulates intracellular adenyl cyclase to catalyze the conversion of adenosine triphosphate to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels result in relaxation of bronchiolar smooth muscle, bronchodilation and increased bronchial airflow."

Binding and activation of the glucocorticoid receptor results in the activation of lipocortin that in turn inhibits cytosolic phospholipase A2, which triggers cascade of reactions involved in synthesis of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Secondly, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1 is induced, thereby leads to dephosphorylation and inactivation of Jun N-terminal kinase directly inhibiting c-Jun mediated transcription. Finally, transcriptional activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B is blocked, thereby inhibits the transcription of cyclooxygenase 2, which is essential for prostaglandin production."
