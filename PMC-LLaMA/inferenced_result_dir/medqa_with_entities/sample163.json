    "question": "A 32-year-old man with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department by his roommate because of a 2-week history of progressively worsening headache and vomiting. Current medications include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dolutegravir, and tenofovir-emtricitabine. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. A lumbar puncture is performed and shows an opening pressure of 32 cm H2O (N: < 20). The pathogen isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be cultured on Sabouraud agar. Further evaluation of this patient's CSF is most likely to show which of the following additional findings?",
