    "question": "A 51-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of a 3-week history of abnormal behavior. His wife reports he has been preoccupied with gambling at the local casino. He becomes restless and irritable when his wife attempts to restrict his gambling. Four months ago, he was diagnosed with Parkinson disease and treatment was initiated. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Peripheral inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase",
      "B": "Direct activation of dopamine receptors",
      "C": "Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B",
      "D": "Inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient was most likely prescribed levodopa, which is a precursor of dopamine. Levodopa is metabolized by two enzymes, DOPA decarboxylase and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) and homovanillic acid. DOPA decarboxylase is present in the brain and peripheral tissues. COMT is present in peripheral tissues and the brain. DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (carbidopa and benserazide) are often used in conjunction with levodopa to increase the amount of levodopa that crosses the blood-brain barrier and is available to be metabolized by DOPA decarboxylase to 3-OMD. DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Direct activation of dopamine receptors (option B) is not a mechanism of action of any anti-Parkinson medications. Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B (option C) is the mechanism of action of selegiline.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
