    "question": "A 25-year-old, G2P2L2 woman presents with a complaint of missed menstrual cycle for 4 weeks. Her previous menstrual cycles were regular, occurring every 28â€“35 days consistently. The patient does not have any other complaints currently. Her past medical history reveals two uncomplicated and normal vaginal deliveries at term. She has a 2-year-old boy and a 6-month-old girl. The patient and her partner use the withdrawal method for contraception. The urine pregnancy test result is positive. The patient returns to the clinic after 1 week expressing her desire to discontinue with the pregnancy and inquires about the possibility of an elective abortion. Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)",
      "B": "Oxytocin-induced labor",
      "C": "Manual uterine aspiration",
      "D": "Oral mifepristone + misoprostol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient is manual uterine aspiration. Manual uterine aspiration, also known as \"menstrual regulation,\" is the most commonly used method for first-trimester abortion in India and China. This method is used for pregnancies of less than 12 weeks' gestation. A sterile speculum is used to expose the cervix, and a plastic cannula is inserted into the uterine cavity. The suction is turned on, and the cavity is emptied by gentle but thorough aspiration. Dilatation and evacuation (D&E) is the most common second-trimester abortion procedure. In this procedure, the cervix is dilated, and the fetal parts are removed using a combination of suction and forceps. Oxytocin-induced labor is the most common method for second-trimester abortion in the United States. In this procedure, high doses of oxytocin are used to induce labor and deliver the fetus. Oral mifepristone plus misoprostol is a medical method for first-trimester abortion. Mifepristone is a progesterone antagonist that causes decidual breakdown. It is followed in 24-48 hours by misoprostol, which is a prostaglandin analogue.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
