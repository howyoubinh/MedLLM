    "question": "Two hours following an elective cholecystectomy, a 43-year-old woman has fever and chills. The patient received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis and one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure. She underwent a hysterectomy 9 years ago for leiomyomata uteri. She has a 5-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Her temperature is 39.5°C (102.3°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a mildly tender abdominal wound without erythema. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. She had a Foley catheter and peripheral line access placed at the time of the procedure. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Adverse effect of medication",
      "B": "Malignant hyperthermia",
      "C": "Urinary tract infection",
      "D": "Transfusion reaction"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms of fever and chills are concerning for infection. The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, which decreases the likelihood of infection at the operative site. However, other sources of infection should be considered. The urinary tract is a common site of infection, especially in the postoperative period. The patient has no abdominal tenderness, which makes a wound infection less likely. The Foley catheter can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract. The patient's history of hypertension and age suggest that she may have chronic kidney disease, which can predispose her to urinary tract infections. The patient's temperature is not excessively elevated, which makes malignant hyperthermia less likely. The patient's history of a previous hysterectomy is not likely related to her current symptoms.\n\nThe patient's fever and chills are concerning for infection. The most likely source of infection is the urinary tract. The patient has a Foley catheter, which can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract. The patient's history of hypertension and age suggest that she may have chronic kidney disease, which can predispose her to urinary tract infections.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
