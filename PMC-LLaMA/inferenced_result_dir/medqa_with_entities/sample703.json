    "question": "A 55-year-old caucasian male is transferred to a tertiary care hospital from a small county hospital where he presented with jaundice and severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back. While in the county hospital, he did not develop fever, and his vital signs were stable for the 48 hours he spent at there. Initial laboratory tests are given below:\nTotal bilirubin 7 mg/dL\nDirect bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL\nAST 100\nALT 40\nAlkaline phosphatase 480 IU/L\nGlucose 160 mg/dL\nThe patientâ€™s medical history is relevant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He admits to smoking cigarettes since his early teenage years. Moderate icterus is evident during physical examination, the abdomen is distended and dull to percussion, and there is periumbilical tenderness. Which of the following markers would you expect to be elevated in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "CA 125",
      "B": "Desmin",
      "C": "CA 27-29",
      "D": "CA 19-9"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation is consistent with acute pancreatitis. The most common etiology is gallstones, which are radiopaque and can be seen on the given X-ray. The elevated alkaline phosphatase is consistent with biliary obstruction. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker for colon cancer and pancreatic cancer. It is also elevated in patients with pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
