    "question": "A 66-year-old woman presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region. She reports that she has not urinated for the past 2 days and that the urine leakage occurs during both day and night and is not associated with physical exertion. The medical history is significant for arterial hypertension and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years, and depression for 3 years. She is prescribed amlodipine, valsartan, atorvastatin, metformin, and amitriptyline. Her weight is 75 kg (165 lb) and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 40 in). Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.4℃ (97.5℉). The physical examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness with a distended urinary bladder that is palpated in the suprapubic region. The neurological examination shows decreased Achilles reflexes bilaterally, and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation. On gynecologic examination, the cervix was normally positioned, mobile, and without any visible lesions. Bulging of the posterior vaginal wall was noted. The adnexa were not palpable. An ultrasound examination showed an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities. Which of the following is  the next step in managing this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Installing a vaginal pessary",
      "B": "Bladder catheterization",
      "C": "Cystostomy",
      "D": "Prescribing prostaglandin E2"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with urinary retention due to bladder outlet obstruction. The most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in women is pelvic organ prolapse with a cystocele. In this case, the cystocele is large enough to obstruct the bladder outlet. The initial management of this condition is usually performed by transurethral bladder catheterization. However, this procedure may be difficult due to the distended bladder and the presence of a cystocele. In such cases, the placement of a vaginal pessary is the first step to facilitate the transurethral bladder catheterization. If the bladder catheterization fails, clean intermittent self-catheterization is initiated. If the patient fails to empty the bladder, a suprapubic cystostomy may be required.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
