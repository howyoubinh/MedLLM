    "question": "A 75-year-old man presents to a medical clinic for evaluation of a large, tense, pruritic bulla on his inner thighs, abdomen, and lower abdomen. A skin biopsy is performed, which shows an epidermal basement membrane with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and linear immunofluorescence. Which of the following is the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Desmosomes",
      "B": "Gap junctions",
      "C": "Hemidesmosomes",
      "D": "Tight junctions"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A. Desmosomes. This is a case of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin. The antibodies bind to desmosomes, which are the major adhesion complexes in the epidermis. This leads to acantholysis, or loss of cohesion between keratinocytes, resulting in the formation of large, tense blisters. The other cell junctions listed are not involved in bullous pemphigoid.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
