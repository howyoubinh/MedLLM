    "question": "A 28-year-old female visits her physician for workup of a new onset diastolic murmur found on physical examination. Past medical history is insignificant. Her temperature is 37.0 degrees C, blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The patient denies dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium. This patient is most at risk for:",

      "A": "Abrupt hypotension",
      "B": "Sudden cardiac death",
      "C": "Acute arterial occlusion",
      "D": "Septic embolism"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is most at risk for sudden cardiac death. The presence of a pedunculated left atrial tumor, or \"floating ball,\" is associated with a high incidence of systemic embolism, stroke, and sudden death. The risk of embolism appears to be related to the size of the tumor. Tumors smaller than 2 cm in diameter rarely cause symptoms. In contrast, tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter have a 50% incidence of embolic events. The most common embolic events are arterial occlusions of the extremities. Central nervous system events (i.e., stroke) occur in approximately 25% of patients. Sudden death is the most devastating complication and occurs in less than 10% of patients. The most common cause of death is thought to be arrhythmias.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
