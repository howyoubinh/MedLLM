    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor with a lesion on her left labia. She first noticed the lesion 3 days ago. The patient describes the lesion as painful and swollen. She denies vaginal discharge. Her past medical history is notable for mild intermittent asthma, gout, and obesity. She uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and takes allopurinol. She has had 5 sexual partners in the past year and uses the pull-out method for contraception. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history and drinks 10-12 alcoholic beverages per week. On exam, she has an ulcerated, tender, and purulent ulcer on the left labia majora. The patient has mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. This patient's condition is most likely caused by which of the following pathogens?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Klebsiella granulomatis",
      "B": "Herpes simplex virus type 2",
      "C": "Haemophilus ducreyi",
      "D": "Treponema pallidum"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation is consistent with a painful genital ulcer with inguinal lymphadenopathy. The most common cause of genital ulcers in sexually active individuals is herpes simplex virus type 2. However, the clinical presentation of chancroid is very similar to that of genital herpes. Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid. It is a painful genital ulcer with inguinal lymphadenopathy. The lymph nodes may become fluctuant and rupture, forming buboes. The causative organism is a gram-negative coccobacillus. The treatment of choice is erythromycin. The other organisms are not typically associated with painful genital ulcers.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
