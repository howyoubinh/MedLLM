    "question": "A 23-year-old man presents with swelling of the left knee. He noticed the swelling a day ago while preparing for the college basketball game. He has had approximately 10 different sexual partners in the past 3 months. Synovial fluid tap shows a WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3. What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patientâ€™s most likely condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Metabolic inhibitor",
      "B": "Cell wall inhibitor",
      "C": "Neutrophil migration inhibitor",
      "D": "Prostaglandin inhibitor"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of a high WBC count in the synovial fluid suggests the diagnosis of septic arthritis. The most common organism causing septic arthritis is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for the treatment of gonococcal infections. Ceftriaxone acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
