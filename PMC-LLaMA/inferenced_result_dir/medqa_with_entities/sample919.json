    "question": "A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with hip and back pain. The patient states that this weekend he had a barbecue. When he was lifting a heavy object he suddenly felt pain in his lower back. He describes the pain as in his buttocks but states that at times it travels down his leg. The patient states that it feels, \"electrical.\" The patient has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, diverticulosis, constipation, and a surgical repair of his anterior cruciate ligament. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, fluoxetine, and sodium docusate. Which of the following is most likely to help confirm the diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh",
      "B": "Straight leg raise",
      "C": "Internal rotation of the extended hip",
      "D": "Radiography"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The diagnosis is a herniated disk at L5-S1. The L5 nerve root is being compressed and is causing the sciatic symptoms. The physical examination findings of a positive straight leg raise test and an absent ankle jerk can help confirm the diagnosis. The straight leg raise test is performed by passively raising the patient's leg while he is lying on his back. The test is considered to be positive if it reproduces the pain in the back of the thigh or in the leg. The ankle jerk is tested by tapping the tendon on the side of the ankle and observing for a knee jerk. The ankle jerk is considered to be absent if it is not present on three separate occasions. The other physical examination maneuvers are used to test other diagnoses. A flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh would stretch the femoral nerve and would not be helpful in diagnosing a herniated disk. An internal rotation of the extended hip would stretch the obturator nerve and would not be helpful in diagnosing a herniated disk. Radiography would not be helpful in diagnosing a herniated disk. A CT scan or MRI would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
