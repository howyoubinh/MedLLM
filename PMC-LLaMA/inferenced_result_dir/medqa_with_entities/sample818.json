    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor for a prenatal visit. She has just learned that she is pregnant and estimates she is approximately 6 weeks pregnant given the timing of her last menstrual cycle. She has a history of recurrent fetal loss. In total, she has had 4 miscarriages between the gestational ages of 8 and 15 weeks. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and has had several DVTs in the past and a clot in her lung once. Her vitals today are unremarkable. She is asking if there are any treatments she should receive to prevent fetal loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Aspirin and heparin",
      "B": "Aspirin and warfarin",
      "C": "No treatment indicated",
      "D": "Rivaroxaban"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient should be treated with aspirin and heparin. The most common cause of fetal loss in women with systemic lupus erythematosus is placental insufficiency due to uteroplacental blood flow abnormalities. These women are at increased risk for both arterial and venous thrombosis. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg) and unfractionated heparin (5000 units twice daily) should be initiated between 4 and 8 weeks' gestation. This therapy has been shown to increase significantly the rate of live births in women with systemic lupus erythematosus and prior pregnancy loss. Warfarin should be avoided in pregnancy because it is a known teratogen. Rivaroxaban is an oral factor Xa inhibitor. It is not recommended for use in pregnancy as there is little data on its safety.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
