    "question": "A 75-year-old man presents to the physician for his annual blood pressure visit and blood work. He has no complaints other than occasional knee pain. The past medical history includes hypertension. He has had knee osteoarthritis for several years and takes occasional acetaminophen for pain control. His diet is full of vegetables. He exercises every day. He has no history of smoking. He had a brother who died at the age of 84 due to hematologic malignancy. The temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉), and the blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities other than a reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees. The laboratory test results are as follows:\nHemoglobin 15 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 58,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nFlow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)",
      "B": "Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL)",
      "C": "Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)",
      "D": "Multiple myeloma (MM)"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clonal disorder of B lymphocytes. The peripheral blood contains increased numbers of mature-appearing lymphocytes. Flow cytometry confirms the B cell nature of the process by demonstrating the typical pan-B cell markers CD19 and CD20. CD5 and CD23 are also positive in CLL, but these are not specific. The absence of myeloperoxidase or lysozyme activity excludes a leukemoid reaction or a myeloid disorder. The lymph nodes are diffusely effaced by predominantly small lymphocytes with condensed chromatin, and scanty cytoplasm. The bone marrow is usually diffusely involved, and shows a pattern similar to that seen in the peripheral blood. The clinical course of CLL is variable. Many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, but the course is typically progressive. The median survival is 7-8 years following diagnosis, but much longer symptom-free survivals are quite common. The diagnosis of monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is made when a patient has a persistent (>6 months) absolute lymphocyte count greater than 5,000/mm3, and a clonal lymphocyte population is detected by flow cytometry. MBL is an asymptomatic condition that may progress to CLL or another lymphoid disorder such as Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. The diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) requires a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL, and less than 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow. MGUS is an asymptomatic condition that may progress to multiple myeloma (MM). MM is characterized by a serum monoclonal protein concentration greater than 3 g/dL, and bone marrow plasma cells greater than 10%. The clinical course of MM is highly variable. The median survival is 5 years with appropriate therapy. The diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) requires a sustained absolute lymphocyte count greater than 5,000/mm3, and a clonal lymphocyte population detected by flow cytometry. CLL is an asymptomatic condition that may progress to lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and bone marrow failure.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
