    "question": "A 74-year-old man has been treated for prostate cancer for the past 6 months. He is on an experimental drug (drug X) that is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor. Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking. The patient has no significant complaints, except for excessive sweating at times. On physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. No other abnormal findings are present. Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Leuprolide",
      "B": "Finasteride",
      "C": "Flutamide",
      "D": "Anastrozole"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The medication is likely flutamide, which is an anti-androgen. The excessive sweating is a common side effect of flutamide. Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist. Finasteride is a 5-a-reductase inhibitor. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
