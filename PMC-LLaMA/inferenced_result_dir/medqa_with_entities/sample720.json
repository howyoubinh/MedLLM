    "question": "A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, she is stable and says that she hit a car at an intersection that \"came out of nowhere\". She states that she had similar close encounters with other cars these past few weeks but was able to avoid collisions with those. She has also had intermittent headaches over the last month and has noticed that her shirts have been getting wet unexpectedly. Blood tests reveal an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance. Which of following changes is also associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased oxytocin",
      "B": "Decreased progesterone",
      "C": "Increased follicle stimulating hormone",
      "D": "Increased progesterone"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The woman is experiencing episodes of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, which causes hyponatremia and water intoxication. This leads to the symptoms of headache and drowsiness. The syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) is characterized by excessive secretion of ADH, often by neoplastic cells. This results in excessive water retention, leading to dilutional hyponatremia. SIADH is associated with increased secretion of oxytocin and prolactin. The increased water retention also causes an increase in blood volume, which can stimulate the renin-angiotensin system and result in an increase in aldosterone secretion.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
