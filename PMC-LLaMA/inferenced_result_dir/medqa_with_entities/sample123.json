    "question": "A 41-year-old G3P1 woman presents with a sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications.  Her last two pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8℃ (98.2℉). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nPlatelet count 230,000/mm3\nFibrinogen 3.5 g/L\nActivated partial thromboplastin time  70 s\nThrombin time 34 s\n A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?",

      "A": "Mixing study",
      "B": "INR",
      "C": "Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test",
      "D": "Clot retraction study"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This is a case of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). CT shows a hyperdensity in the superior sagittal sinus (arrow). CVST is a life-threatening condition that is often associated with pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, and the postpaum period. It is caused by a hypercoagulable state. The mainstay of treatment is anticoagulation. The initial anticoagulant of choice is heparin, which is followed by warfarin. The risk of intracranial hemorrhage with anticoagulation is high, so close monitoring of the patient is necessary. Mixing studies are used to determine the presence of a hypercoagulable state. The Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test is used to determine the presence of von Willebrand disease. The clot retraction study is used to determine the presence of a qualitative platelet disorder.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
