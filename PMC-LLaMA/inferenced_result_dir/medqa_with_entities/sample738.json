    "question": "Public health researchers are reviewing data from an outbreak of hepatitis A that was traced to contaminated produce from a popular restaurant. A case series investigation with prospective and retrospective follow-up found that 500 individuals dined at the restaurant during the week of study. The incidence of hepatitis A infection was found to be 25%, and the total number of deaths recorded among the incident cases was 5 individuals. What was the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak?",
    "options": {
      "A": "4%",
      "B": "10%",
      "C": "20%",
      "D": "25%"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The case-fatality rate is calculated as the total number of deaths recorded among the incident cases divided by the total number of cases. In this case, the numerator is 5 and the denominator is 250 (the total number of cases). Thus, the case-fatality rate is 5 divided by 250, which equals 20%.\n\n###SPECIAL NOTE:\n\nCase-fatality rate is typically used in acute infectious diseases. It is not a good measure of the severity of chronic diseases. Case-fatality rate is closely related to the case-incidence rate. The product of the two rates is roughly equal to the prevalence of the disease.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

State-of-the-art reviews tend to address more current matters. A review of the literature must be differentiated from HISTORICAL ARTICLE on the same subject, but a review of historical literature is also within the scope of this publication type."
