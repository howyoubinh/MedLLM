    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to the office because she has felt a small painless mass in her neck which has been slowly growing. She has no relevant past medical history. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical exam of the thyroid gland, a solitary nodule is palpated. It is fixed to the surrounding tissues and nontender. TSH is normal, and antithyroid antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Endemic goiter",
      "B": "Follicular carcinoma",
      "C": "Hashimoto thyroiditis",
      "D": "Papillary carcinoma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The incidence of thyroid carcinoma has been increasing in recent years. In this patient, the presence of a solitary thyroid nodule suggests a higher chance of malignancy. Follicular carcinoma is a malignancy that arises from follicular cells. It is usually not associated with a palpable nodule. Papillary carcinoma is the most common thyroid malignancy and is usually associated with a palpable nodule. Hashimoto thyroiditis is a common cause of a painless thyroid nodule. It is associated with an enlarged gland and an elevated TSH. Endemic goiter is usually associated with an enlarged thyroid gland and is caused by iodine deficiency.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
