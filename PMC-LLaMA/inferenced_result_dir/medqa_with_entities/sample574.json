    "question": "An 11-year-old boy presents to your office with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours. You suspect that this patient has experienced a loss of polyanions in his glomerular basement membranes. Which of the following findings would confirm your diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "WBC casts in the urine",
      "B": "Selective albuminuria",
      "C": "Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine",
      "D": "Bence-Jones proteinuria"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient most likely has, or is developing, minimal change disease (MCD), also known as nil lesion. This is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Patients with MCD have loss of polyanions in their glomerular basement membranes. This loss of negative charge results in selective albuminuria. Albumin is the least negatively charged of the plasma proteins. Other findings in MCD include periorbital edema, fatty casts in the urine, and lipiduria. WBC casts in the urine are associated with pyelonephritis. Bence-Jones proteins are light chains found in multiple myeloma. They are not associated with MCD.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
