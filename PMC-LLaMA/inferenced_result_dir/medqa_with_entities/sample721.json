    "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?",

The arachnoid villi are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater that project into the subarachnoid space. The interventricular foramen (of Monro) connects the lateral ventricle with the third ventricle. The median aperture (of Magendie) is the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct connects the third ventricle with the fourth ventricle.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
