    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of a headache. The last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She also reports having a mild headache for 1 month. There has been a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina for the last 15 days. On examination, the fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus and no fetal heart sounds are heard. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 108/min. On USG examination, no fetal parts are seen. What will be the genotype of the substance which will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "69XXY",
      "B": "23XX",
      "C": "47XYY",
      "D": "46XX"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The genotype of the substance aspirated from the uterus in this case is 'A', i.e. 47XYY. The history of amenorrhea followed by abnormal uterine enlargement and then the presence of a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina is suggestive of a molar pregnancy. The absence of fetal heart sounds and the fundal height at the level of the umbilicus are also suggestive of a molar pregnancy. The genotype of the molar substance is 47XYY. The genotype of the father is not known. The genotype of the mother can be 'B' or 'C' but not 'A'.\n\nMolar pregnancy is associated with increased levels of HCG. The levels of HCG in a normal pregnancy doubles every 2-3 days. In a molar pregnancy, however, the levels of HCG increase at a rate of 1.4-2.5% per day.\n\nThe USG findings of a complete mole are:\n\n1. A uterus filled with tissue of a size greater than the period of amenorrhea.\n2. A heterogeneous echogenic uterine mass with numerous anechoic or hypoechoic cystic spaces.\n3. Absence of a fetus or amniotic sac.\n4. Presence of a placenta with a retroplacental sonolucent zone.\n5. Increased intrauterine fluid.\n\nThe genotypes of the products of conception in some other conditions are as follows:\n\n1. Trisomy 21: 47XX + 21\n2. Trisomy 18: 47XX + 18\n3. Trisomy 13: 47XX + 13\n4. Monosomy XO: 45XO\n5. Mosaicism: 46XX/45XO\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
