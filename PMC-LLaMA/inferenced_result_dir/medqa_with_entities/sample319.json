    "question": "A 22-year-old man presents to a psychiatrist complaining of mood fluctuations. He is accompanied by his mother who reports that the patient recently experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy. The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent’s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient’s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bipolar II disorder",
      "B": "Cyclothymic disorder",
      "C": "Persistent depressive disorder",
      "D": "Schizoaffective disorder"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s history is suggestive of cyclothymic disorder. The history of meningoencephalitis is noteworthy, as it may have contributed to the development of the mood disorder. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for cyclothymic disorder include numerous periods of both hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode, hypomanic episode, or manic episode, and that must have a duration of at least two years. The symptoms are not severe enough to meet full diagnostic criteria for a hypomanic episode or a major depressive episode. The patient’s history of feeling guilty and sad, as well as his spendthrift episode, are consistent with a hypomanic episode. The history of meningoencephalitis is noteworthy, as it may have contributed to the development of the mood disorder.\n\nBipolar II disorder is characterized by episodes of major depression and hypomania. The patient’s history does not include sufficient episodes of hypomania to meet criteria for Bipolar II disorder.\n\nPersistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years in adults. The patient’s history does not include sufficient periods of elevated mood to meet criteria for this diagnosis.\n\nSchizoaffective disorder is characterized by a combination of psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) and mood episodes. The patient’s history does not include psychotic symptoms that meet criteria for schizoaffective disorder.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
