    "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents to her family physician with a 3-week history of swollen neck. The small, round, and painless swelling, which was detected 3 weeks ago in the middle of her neck, has now increased in size. The swelling is associated with sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue; however, the patient does not complain of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling. The patient’s medical history is negative for similar symptoms or a thyroid disorder. The vital signs are within normal limits. Local examination reveals a 3 x 3 cm round, non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile swelling in the anterior triangle of her neck. The patient carries a total white blood cell count of 10,200/mm3, including 70% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, and zero eosinophils.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 20 mm/hr (normal, 0–29 mm/hr). What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Graves' disease",
      "B": "De Quervain’s thyroiditis",
      "C": "Silent thyroiditis",
      "D": "Hashimoto’s thyroiditis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is de Quervain’s thyroiditis. The clinical presentation of painless swelling in the anterior part of the neck, associated with systemic symptoms (sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, fatigue), is consistent with de Quervain’s thyroiditis. The laboratory findings, including an increased white blood cell count with relative lymphocytosis and a low erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Graves' disease, silent thyroiditis, and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are characterized by diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, exophthalmos, and/or symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
