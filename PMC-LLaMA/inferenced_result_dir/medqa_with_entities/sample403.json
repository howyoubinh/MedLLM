    "question": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The episodes occur every 1–2 months and last for a few hours. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His mother is concerned that his condition might be hereditary because his older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 75th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis",
      "B": "Biliary cyst",
      "C": "Intestinal malrotation",
      "D": "Pancreas divisum"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The incidence of congenital hyperophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is approximately 1–3 cases per 1000 births. The condition is most commonly seen in first-born males between 3 and 6 weeks of age. The classic history is of nonbilious vomiting that becomes increasingly projectile over the course of several days to weeks. Eventually, the infant develops almost complete gastric outlet obstruction. The examination of the abdomen reveals a visible gastric peristalsis, and the mass is palpable in the epigastrium. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound examination. Biliary cysts are congenital cystic dilations of the biliary tree. They are usually identified by the presence of a mass in the right upper quadrant and are associated with other congenital anomalies in 30% of cases. Intestinal malrotation is a condition in which the intestines do not rotate into their normal position as they prolapse into the base of the umbilical cord. The result is that the cecum is located in the right upper quadrant and the duodenojejunal junction is to the left of the midline. The condition is often associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and congenital heart disease. The classic clinical presentation is that of acute bilious vomiting in a neonate. The abdominal radiograph shows a \"double bubble\" sign, and the diagnosis is confirmed by upper gastrointestinal contrast study. Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly in which the pancreatic ducts fail to fuse. The majority of patients are asymptomatic, but a small percentage can present with abdominal pain and recurrent pancreatitis. The diagnosis is made by ERCP.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
