    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for evaluation of progressively worsening swelling around the eyes. He has no history of major medical illness. He had a sore throat and cough 2 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. Physical examination shows moderate periorbital edema and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. A kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. Which of the following is most likely to be found on urinalysis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins",
      "B": "Fatty casts and albumin",
      "C": "White blood cell casts and eosinophils",
      "D": "Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has nephrotic syndrome. The most common cause in children is minimal change disease, which is characterized by effacement of the podocyte foot processes on electron microscopy. The loss of anionic sites on the podocytes results in selective proteinuria of low molecular weight proteins (albumin, 70 kD) and thus hypoalbuminemia. The urine shows heavy proteinuria (nephrotic range >3 g/d), which results in hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <2.5 g/dL). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and thus to a rise in plasma hyaluronic acid. The urine also shows large amounts of hyaline casts. Immunoglobulin excretion is increased in some patients with minimal change disease (up to 1 to 2 g/d), but is not a feature of the disease that leads to the presentation in this case. Fatty casts and albumin are features of the nephrotic syndrome, but are not specific for minimal change disease. White blood cell casts and eosinophils are features of acute pyelonephritis. Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells are features of acute tubular necrosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
