    "question": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 7-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath. She has a history of asthma and has frequent exacerbations despite receiving maximal medical therapy. Physical examination shows scattered expiratory wheezing. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 9,800/mm3 (13% eosinophils) and elevated serum concentration of immunoglobulin E. An x-ray of the chest shows thickened bronchial walls and perihilar opacities. Sputum culture shows scattered septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees. Which of the following is most likely to be increased in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "IL-28",
      "B": "TGF-β",
      "C": "IFN-α",
      "D": "IL-4"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has an allergic reaction with eosinophilia and elevated immunoglobulin E. The eosinophils release products such as IL-5 that stimulate the production of IgE. The helper T cell subset (Th2) secretes IL-4, which stimulates IgE production. The Th1 subset secretes IFN-γ, which suppresses IgE production. The Th1 subset also secretes IL-28, which is an important cytokine in the interferon cascade. TGF-β is a cytokine that is secreted by regulatory T cells and suppresses the activity of Th1 and Th2 cells.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
