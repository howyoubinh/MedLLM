    "question": "A 69-year-old right-handed man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. On questioning, he has had some difficulty speaking for 3 months. During a conversation, he often has difficulty repeating what his interlocutor has said. He has hypertension and takes hydrochlorothiazide. His vital signs are within normal limits. The patient speaks fluently in full sentences and demonstrates normal comprehension. When asked to say the word “kindergarten,” he replies with, “Sintelmarvin… no, that's wrong…kinterflargin, no that isn't it either...kantolargen...no? How about, kindergarten?” The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is occlusion of a branch of which of the following arteries?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Left middle cerebral",
      "B": "Right vertebral",
      "C": "Left posterior inferior cerebellar",
      "D": "Left penetrating"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a nonfluent aphasia, which is a feature of lesions of the dominant hemisphere (usually the left) in the region of the superior branch of the left middle cerebral artery. This area is known as Wernicke's area. The patient is unable to speak fluently or repeat words, but has normal comprehension. In contrast, a patient with a lesion in Broca's area (usually due to a lesion in the inferior branch of the left middle cerebral artery) will have difficulty with spoken speech, but will be able to comprehend language and repeat words. The patient's hypertension has led to an ischemic stroke. The other arteries listed do not supply the regions necessary for language production and comprehension.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
