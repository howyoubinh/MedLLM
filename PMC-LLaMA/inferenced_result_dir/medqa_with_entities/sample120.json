    "question": "A 60-year-old female presents to her gynecologist with vaginal bleeding. She underwent menopause ten years prior. She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria. Ligation of which of the following vessels most likely contributed to this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Artery of Sampson",
      "B": "Ovarian artery",
      "C": "Superior vesical artery",
      "D": "Uterine artery"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s postoperative flank pain and oliguria are consistent with acute renal failure secondary to a ligated renal artery. The uterine artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery, which is ligated during a hysterectomy. The uterine artery gives off the artery of Sampson, which supplies the medial aspect of the upper thigh. The ovarian artery is a branch of the abdominal aorta. The superior vesical artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies the bladder. The inferior vesical artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies the bladder.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
