    "question": "A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, comes to the emergency department because of sudden-onset, severe right flank pain. She was in her aerobics class when the pain started but denies any trauma to the region. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts. Menses occur regularly at 28-day intervals. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F). Abdominal examination shows tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. Pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary. Right ovarian artery flow is detectable on Doppler, but there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Broad ligament",
      "B": "Ovarian ligament",
      "C": "Cardinal ligament",
      "D": "Infundibulopelvic ligament"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The right ovarian vein drains the right ovary and flows through the inferior vena cava into the right atrium. The right ovarian vein travels anterior to the ureter, crossing beneath the external iliac vessels at the pelvic inlet. The right ovarian vein then travels medial to the pelvic brim and beneath the fallopian tube and uterine artery to enter the internal iliac vein. The ligament that supports the ovary is the ovarian ligament. The broad ligament is a double-fold of parietal peritoneum that hangs over the uterus and the ovary. The cardinal ligament is the major support of the uterus. The infundibulopelvic ligament attaches the ovary to the fallopian tube and supports the ovary at the pelvic inlet. The round ligament of the uterus is a cord that attaches the lateral portion of the uterus to the inner aspect of the labium majus.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
