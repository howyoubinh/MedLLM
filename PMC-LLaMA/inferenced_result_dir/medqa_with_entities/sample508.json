    "question": "A 21-year-old old college student is brought to the emergency department by his roommates because he has been \"acting strangely.\" Over the last 7 months, he has claimed to hear voices telling him that he must prepare for the end of the world. He used to be a straight A student but started failing exams recently due to his erratic behavior. Furthermore, there are periods of time where he does not sleep for several days and redecorates the entire apartment. During those times he spends huge amounts of money on online shopping. These periods usually last for about 2 weeks and happen every other month. On physical exam, he appears unkept and irritated. He seems to respond to invisible stimuli, and he jumps from topic to topic without clear focus. Which of the following is most consistent with this patient's presentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Brief psychotic disorder",
      "B": "Schizoaffective disorder",
      "C": "Schizophreniform disorder",
      "D": "Schizotypal personality disorder"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "###Rationale: The patient's erratic behavior, periods of elated mood, disorganized speech and failure of social and occupational functioning are all consistent with a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. This disorder is characterized by all of the symptoms of schizophrenia but lasting between 1 and 6 months. The other diagnoses listed do not fit as well with the patient's symptoms. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychosis, but it does not have the chronic course of schizophreniform disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by a combination of psychotic symptoms and mood disorder symptoms, but the patient does not exhibit any mood symptoms. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior and odd beliefs, but it does not cause the severe functional impairment seen in this patient.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
