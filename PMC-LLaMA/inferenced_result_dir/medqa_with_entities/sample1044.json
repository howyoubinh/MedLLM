A scotch tape test is found to be positive and mebendazole is prescribed. Into which of the following subsets have the naïve T cells (TH0) developed due to the infection in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "TH1 cells",
      "B": "TH2 cells",
      "C": "TH17",

  "model_response": "The TH17 subset of T helper cells is induced by IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23. These cells promote inflammatory and immune responses against pathogens, particularly against fungi and bacteria. The TH1 subset (choice A) is induced by IL-12 and is important in cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. TH2 cells (choice B) are important in immune responses to parasites and are induced by IL-4. TH0 cells (choice C) are an uncommitted subset of T cells. Treg cells (choice E) are a subset of T cells that suppress immune responses and are induced by TGF-b.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
