    "question": "A 6-year-old Russian boy who recently immigrated to the United States presents to your office with fever and dyspnea. On examination of the oropharynx, you note a grayish-white pseudomembrane and uneven elevation of the soft palate. The patient displays marked enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. Which of the following describes the organism responsible for this patient's disease?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Yeast with pseudohyphae",
      "B": "Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation",
      "C": "Gram-positive cocci with hyaluronic acid capsule",
      "D": "Gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's presentation is most consistent with infection with Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which produces a toxin that inhibits protein synthesis via ADP ribosylation. The pseudomembrane seen in the oropharynx is the result of the necrotizing effect of the toxin. The organism is a gram-positive bacillus that characteristically appears in Chinese letter or cuneiform arrangement. The pseudohyphae described in the first choice are a characteristic of Candida species. The second choice describes the effect of the toxin produced by C. botulinum. The third choice describes the organism responsible for a form of pneumonia in the newborn. The fourth choice describes the organism responsible for a form of pneumonia in the elderly.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
