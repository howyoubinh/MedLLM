Echocardiography shows a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

      "A": "Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching",

      "D": "Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound"
    }

  "model_response": "The murmur described is that of a systolic ejection murmur that increases with hand clenching (Hurst). This finding suggests that the defect is in the left side of the heart. The other choices are murmurs that suggest valvular defects.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
