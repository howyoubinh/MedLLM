    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a headache. He states that this is the worst headache he has ever had and that his symptoms have not been improving. The patient complains of pain in his jaw that is worse when he chews. He has a past medical history of insomnia and is currently taking alprazolam. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for tenderness over the patient's scalp, jaw, and temporal area. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "CT head",
      "B": "Ibuprofen",
      "C": "IV steroids",
      "D": "Lumbar puncture"

  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The initial diagnostic test of choice is a non-contrast CT scan of the head. If the CT scan is negative, a lumbar puncture is indicated to evaluate for SAH. Ibuprofen and IV steroids would not be appropriate in this case.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
