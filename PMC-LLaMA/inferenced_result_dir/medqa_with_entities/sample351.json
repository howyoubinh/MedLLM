    "question": "A 26-year-old nurse comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue. She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, \"\"I know I have cancer.\"\" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale. Her temperature is 36.5° C (97.7° F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. On mental status examination she is tired and has a depressed mood. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. There are numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right-upper sternal border. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. There is generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 7.5 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 89 μm3\nReticulocyte count 13.3%\nSerum\nSodium 139 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nCalcium 8.5 mg/dL\nTest of the stool for occult blood is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\"",
