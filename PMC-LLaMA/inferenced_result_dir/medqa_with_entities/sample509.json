    "question": "An 81-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his son to be evaluated for memory issues. The patient’s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient’s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alzheimer's disease",
      "B": "Lewy body dementia",
      "C": "Normal-pressure hydrocephalus",
      "D": "Vascular dementia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is vascular dementia. He has a history of multiple strokes, which have led to multiple infarcts in the brain. His deficits are a result of these strokes. The fluctuating nature of his symptoms is also consistent with vascular dementia. Alzheimer's disease is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by memory loss. Lewy body dementia is characterized by fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is characterized by gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

The leg is slightly bent at the hip, the knee cannot be extended fully at the end of the stance phase and the foot is inverted and in a plantar flexed position. Gait is slow, with a wide base and asymmetrical with a shortened weight-bearing phase on the paretic side. During the swing phase, the paretic leg performs a lateral movement (circumduction) which is characteristic of this gait disorder, also termed Wernicke-Mann gait. Spastic gait problems typically worsen on attempts to walk faster. [PMID:27770207]"
