    "question": "A 70-year-old hypertensive and hyperlipidemic woman comes to the emergency department with chief complaints of acute onset of impaired speech and comprehension with a right-sided weakness for the last 1.5 hours. The patient was on 2 antihypertensive medications and a statin, but she was not receiving any antiplatelet drugs. She has a blood pressure of 136/94, heart rate of 84/min, and respiratory rate of 15/min. Initial examination shows global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation. Which of the following cellular processes is typical of the section of reversible injury noted in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Mitochondrial permeability",
      "B": "Caspase activation",
      "C": "Lysosomal rupture",
      "D": "Decreased ATP"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The area of penumbra shows evidence of ongoing ischemia but can potentially be salvaged with prompt reperfusion. The key cellular processes that are occurring in this area are related to energy metabolism and include decreased ATP, increased lactate, and decreased glucose. The other choices represent irreversible injury and are not typically seen in the penumbra.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
