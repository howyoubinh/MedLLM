    "question": "A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "30%",
      "B": "15%",
      "C": "25%",
      "D": "20%"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ejection fraction is calculated as stroke volume divided by end-diastolic volume. In this case, stroke volume is calculated as 1000 = 100 × (end-systolic volume - end-diastolic volume). Therefore, stroke volume is 1000 mL, and end-diastolic volume is 80 mL. Thus, the ejection fraction is 1000 mL divided by 80 mL, or 12.5%.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
