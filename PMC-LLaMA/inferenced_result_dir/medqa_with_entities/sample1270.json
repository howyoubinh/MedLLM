    "question": "A 21-year-old college student comes to the physician because of daytime fatigue for 2 months. He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2–3 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2–3 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Trial of diphenhydramine",
      "B": "Stop evening exercise",
      "C": "Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime",
      "D": "Scheduled afternoon naps"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's history suggests that he has a delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). This condition is frequently seen in adolescents and young adults. It is caused by a delay in the circadian rhythm, which is a 24-hour cycle that regulates many biologic functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. The pineal hormone melatonin plays an important role in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm. Individuals with DSPS have a delayed release of melatonin, which results in a delay of the circadian rhythm. They have difficulty falling asleep in the early evening and awakening in the morning. They often complain of feeling tired in the morning and sleepy in the afternoon. They may try to adjust their sleep schedule by staying up late at night and sleeping late in the morning, but this may interfere with their ability to function during the day. The diagnosis of DSPS is made by obtaining a sleep log for several days and by measuring the melatonin level in a blood sample taken in the morning. The treatment of DSPS includes a trial of diphenhydramine, which will help him fall asleep at night, and scheduled afternoon naps. He should avoid alcoholic beverages in the evening because they can disrupt sleep. He should stop evening exercise because it can delay the circadian rhythm.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
