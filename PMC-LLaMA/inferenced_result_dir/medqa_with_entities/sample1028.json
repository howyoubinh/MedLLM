    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patientâ€™s tumor?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alkaline phosphatase",
      "B": "RNase",
      "C": "Superoxide dismutase",
      "D": "Telomerase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a liposarcoma, which is a malignant tumor that arises from fat cells. Liposarcomas are the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma. Liposarcomas are composed of malignant adipocytes, which are fat cells that have undergone malignant transformation. Liposarcomas are subclassified into four types, based on the type of adipocyte that is present in the tumor. The four types of liposarcoma are myxoid (most common), well-differentiated, pleomorphic, and sclerosing. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is found in the membranes of fat cells. Increased alkaline phosphatase levels are found in patients with liposarcomas, as the tumor is composed of malignant fat cells. RNase is an enzyme that is involved in RNA metabolism and is not associated with liposarcomas. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of superoxide radicals and is not associated with liposarcomas. Telomerase is an enzyme that is responsible for synthesizing telomeres and is not associated with liposarcomas.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
