    "question": "A 52-year-old man with a history of gastric cancer that was treated with subtotal gastrectomy dies in a motor vehicle collision. At autopsy, examination of the spinal cord shows unilateral atrophy of the neurons in the area indicated by the arrow. Neurological examination of the patient when he was still alive would most likely have shown which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased sense of temperature in the ipsilateral arm",
      "B": "Decreased strength of the contralateral leg",
      "C": "Decreased vibratory sense in the ipsilateral arm",
      "D": "Decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The arrow points to the base of the spinal cord, where the posterior column lies. The neurons indicated are those that would have been atrophied in this patient. These neurons are part of the fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus, which carry the sensations of vibration, position, and fine touch. These fibers ascend ipsilaterally, so atrophy on one side will lead to loss of vibration and position sense on the ipsilateral (same side) of the body. The other choices are carried by the spinothalamic tract, which carries crude touch and pain sensations and crosses to the contralateral side of the spinal cord, so atrophy on one side will not lead to loss of these sensations on the ipsilateral side of the body.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
