    "question": "A male newborn born at 27 weeks' gestation is evaluated for rapid breathing and hypoxia shortly after birth. His mother had no prenatal care. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring. An x-ray of the chest shows low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. He is started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bilateral pleural effusions on lung ultrasound",
      "B": "Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture",
      "C": "Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy",
      "D": "Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which is the most common cause of respiratory failure in premature infants. RDS is caused by a deficiency of surfactant, which is produced by type II alveolar cells. Surfactant deficiency leads to an increase in alveolar surface tension, and collapse of the alveoli. On x-ray, this appears as a diffuse reticulogranular pattern, with ground-glass opacities. The initial treatment for RDS is to provide mechanical ventilation with a goal of maintaining PaO2 above 60 mm Hg and PaCO2 below 60 mm Hg. Administration of exogenous surfactant is the next step in management, if ventilatory support is required for more than 6 hours. Bilateral pleural effusions can be seen in RDS, but are less common in the absence of patent ductus aeriosus. Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture would suggest the diagnosis of Candida albicans, which can cause respiratory distress in premature infants. Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli are seen in RDS, but are not specific for this condition. Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning suggests the presence of meconium aspiration syndrome, which is not related to RDS.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
