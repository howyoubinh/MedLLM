    "question": "A 23-year-old woman presents to the hospital for elective surgery. However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?",
    "options": {
      "A": "High IgM, low IgA, and IgE",
      "B": "Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM",
      "C": "High IgE, normal IgA, and IgG",
      "D": "Normal serum immunoglobulin values"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with anaphylaxis, which is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The most common cause of anaphylaxis is iatrogenic, with medications and blood products being the most common causes. The most common immunodeficiency associated with anaphylaxis is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), which is characterized by low levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM. The most common immunodeficiency associated with allergic reactions is IgE, which is increased in patients with allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
