    "question": "A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin over his hands, chest, and legs for 6 hours. He reports having clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. He says that his symptoms began suddenly the previous night, 30 minutes after he had dinner at a seafood restaurant. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal exam shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Diphenhydramine",
      "B": "Fexofenadine",
      "C": "Vitamin K",
      "D": "Calamine lotion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with an allergic reaction, most likely to shellfish. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is diphenhydramine, an antihistamine that can help relieve the itching and uicaria. Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine that is nonsedating and may be used in mild cases. Vitamin K is used in the treatment of bleeding disorders. Calamine lotion is soothing but does not relieve pruritus. Prednisone is a systemic corticosteroid that may be used in severe cases of uicaria.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
