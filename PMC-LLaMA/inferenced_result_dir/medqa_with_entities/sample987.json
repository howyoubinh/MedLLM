    "question": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy",
      "B": "Dietary restriction of phenylalanine",
      "C": "Daily allopurinol intake",
      "D": "Avoidance of fasting states"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has untreated phenylketonuria (PKU). The incidence of this disorder is 1 in 10,000 live births. The patient has a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates in the blood and is converted into phenylketone (phenylpyruvate) and other phenyl-substituted metabolites. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid, and its accumulation leads to growth retardation, microcephaly, and mental retardation. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating an elevated blood phenylalanine level. The treatment is dietary restriction of phenylalanine. This requires the elimination of phenylalanine-containing foods such as milk, cheese, and meat. The other treatments listed are used in the management of other disorders.\n\nLevothyroxine is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine prevents the symptoms of PKU. Daily allopurinol intake is used in the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia. Avoidance of fasting states prevents the symptoms of Reye syndrome.\n\nVitamin K deficiency is not a cause of this patient's symptoms.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
