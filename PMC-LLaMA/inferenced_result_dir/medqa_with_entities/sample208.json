    "question": "A clinical researcher is interested in creating a new drug for HIV patients. Darunavir has been particularly efficacious in recent patients; however, some have experienced an increased incidence of hyperglycemia. A new drug called DN501 is developed with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but fewer side effects. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of DN501?",

Upon oral administration, darunavir selectively targets and binds to the active site of HIV-1 protease, and inhibits the dimerization and catalytic activity of HIV-1 protease. This inhibits the proteolytic cleavage of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-infected cells. This inhibition leads to the production of immature, non-infectious viral proteins that are unable to form mature virions, and prevents HIV replication."
