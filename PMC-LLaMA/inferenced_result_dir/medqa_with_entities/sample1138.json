    "question": "A 62-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. She wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when she does not apply sunscreen. Current medications include demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. Physical examination shows prominent erythema and a papular eruption on her forehead, cheeks, neck, and the dorsum of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Degranulation of presensitized mast cells",
      "B": "Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies",
      "C": "Accumulation of porphobilinogen",
      "D": "Cell injury due to drug metabolites"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's symptoms are most consistent with a diagnosis of phototoxicity. Phototoxicity occurs when a drug or other chemical agent (in this case, demeclocycline) is absorbed into the skin and is photoactivated by exposure to sunlight or a tanning lamp. The activated drug can cause cell injury, resulting in erythema, edema, pruritus, and, in severe cases, vesicle formation and bullae. Mast cell degranulation and immune complex formation would be expected with allergic or hyper- sensitivity reactions, respectively. Porphyria and drug-induced autoantibodies are not associated with these findings.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
