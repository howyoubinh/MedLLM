    "question": "A 36-year-old woman presents with increased tiredness and lethargy for the past 4 weeks. Investigations show her hemoglobin level to be 8.6 gm/dL and serum creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL. The serum is negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and positive for C3 nephritic factor. Urinalysis shows a 3+ proteinuria. The renal biopsy demonstrates hypercellular glomerulus with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. What is the most likely cause?",
