    "question": "A 65-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband after he found her with nausea, headache, and agitation 1 hour ago. When he left their lakeside cabin 6 hours before to go ice fishing and get more firewood, she did not have any symptoms. She has chronic migraines, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her medications include lisinopril and metformin, but she ran out of her anti-hypertensive medications over the weekend. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 154/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Her gait is unsteady. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Intravenous nitroprusside",
      "B": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy",
      "C": "100% oxygen therapy",
      "D": "Heliox therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's acute neurologic dysfunction, including confusion, agitation, and gait unsteadiness, is most likely due to acute hypoxia. The history of being in a closed environment (the cabin) and the development of symptoms shortly after arrival at the emergency department suggest that she may have been exposed to carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in the United States. It is often seen in the winter months when faulty heating systems are used. The history of acute onset of symptoms, confusion, and agitation suggests a diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning. The treatment of choice is 100% oxygen. The oxygen saturation should be monitored with a pulse oximeter. In severe cases, patients may require hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Nitroprusside is a potent arterial and venous vasodilator that is used in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. It does not have a role in the treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning. Heliox therapy is used in the treatment of asthma exacerbations and is not indicated in this case.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
