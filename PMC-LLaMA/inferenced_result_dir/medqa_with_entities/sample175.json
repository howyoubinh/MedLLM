    "question": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was the restrained driver. On questioning by the paramedics, he reported severe chest pain and mild dyspnea. On arrival, he is confused and unable to provide a history. His pulse is 93/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 91/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. He is able to move his extremities in response to commands. He opens his eyes spontaneously. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination shows multiple bruises over the trunk and extremities. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion are noted on the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

  "model_response": "The patient has signs of tension pneumothorax and needs emergency needle decompression followed by insertion of a chest tube.\n\nComment: Tension pneumothorax must be treated as a medical emergency. If the tension in the pleural space is not relieved, the patient is likely to die from inadequate cardiac output or marked hypoxemia. A large-bore needle should be inseed into the pleural space through the second anterior intercostal space. If large amounts of gas escape from the needle after inseion, the diagnosis is confirmed. The needle should be left in place until a thoracostomy tube can be inseed.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
