    "question": "A 56-year-old man of Korean descent visits his primary care provider for an annual health check-up. His personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking and a sedentary lifestyle. He has type-2 diabetes mellitus which is under control with oral medications. Upon physical examination, he is found to have a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg, a pulse of 72/min, a respiratory rate of 18/min, and a body temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). The rest of the examination is unremarkable except for an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node. In addition to a fine needle aspiration or biopsy, which of the following tests should also be included in further assessment of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chest radiograph",
      "B": "Upper gastointestinal endoscopy",
      "C": "Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain",
      "D": "Ultrasound of the neck"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The chest radiograph would be important to rule out a primary lung cancer or metastatic disease. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy would be important to rule out a primary gastric cancer or a malignancy that has spread to a distant site via the bloodstream. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain would be important to rule out a primary brain tumor. An ultrasound of the neck would be important to rule out a primary thyroid cancer or lymphoma.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
