    "question": "A 2-year-old boy in respiratory distress is brought to the emergency department by his parents. They state that approximately one hour after putting their child to sleep, a \"hacking\" cough was heard from his bedroom. After entering his room the parents state their child appeared to be in distress, making a high pitched noise with every breath. Beyond a runny nose for the past few days, the child has been healthy. He has no toys in his bed or access to any other small objects. Physical exam demonstrates a 2-year-old child in respiratory distress.\n\nWhich of the following choices is the proper management for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Humidified oxygen and dexamethasone; discharge if the patient improves",
      "B": "Dexamethasome, racemic epinephrine and observation for 4 hours; discharge if stridor remits",
      "C": "Broncoscopy to remove a foreign body in the upper airway then discharge",
      "D": "Empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotics, intubate and admission"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is most consistent with croup. Croup is a viral infection of the upper airway. Most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus. It is most commonly seen in the fall and winter. Patients typically have a prodrome of upper respiratory symptoms, followed by the development of stridor and respiratory distress. The child may also have a barking cough. Radiographs may show the typical \"steeple sign\" of narrowing of the trachea in the subglottic region. Treatment is humidified oxygen and dexamethasone. Patients will often improve within hours, and can be discharged.\n\nThe other choices are not appropriate for this patient. Treatment for epiglottitis includes IV antibiotics, intubation, and admission. Treatment for foreign body aspiration includes bronchoscopy to remove the foreign body, and admission. Treatment for bacterial tracheitis includes IV antibiotics, endotracheal intubation, and admission.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
