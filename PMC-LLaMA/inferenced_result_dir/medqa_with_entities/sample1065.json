    "question": "A 24-year-old woman gravida 2, para 1 at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Her earlier pregnancy was uncomplicated. This is her 4th prenatal visit. She had an ultrasound scan 2 weeks ago that showed a live intrauterine pregnancy consistent with a 22-week gestation with no anomalies. She had a normal Pap smear 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Her blood group and type is B positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Oral glucose challenge test",
      "B": "Cardiotocography",
      "C": "Swab for GBS culture",
      "D": "Tdap vaccination"
    }

  "model_response": "The patient is at 24 weeks' gestation and has completed the period of organogenesis. She has had a recent ultrasound scan that showed a live intrauterine pregnancy consistent with a 22-week gestation. She has a normal Pap smear 2 years ago. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform an oral glucose challenge test. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2010), in the absence of any abnormalities on the previous prenatal visit, the recommended testing is an oral glucose challenge test. The test is done between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation. If the result is abnormal, then a diagnostic 3-hour glucose tolerance test is performed.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
