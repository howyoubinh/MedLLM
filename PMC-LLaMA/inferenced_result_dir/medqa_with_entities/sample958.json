    "question": "A 61-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss in both eyes for 1 day. His family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother and cousin. His weight is 112 kg ( 246.9 lb), height 187 cm (6 ft 1 in), blood pressure: 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate: 89/min, respiratory rate: 14/min, and temperature: 36.7℃ (98.4℉). The physical examination is significant for dry skin, a pustular rash over the patient’s shoulders and back, an accentuated second heart sound (S2) best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, and distal loss of vibration sensitivity in both feet. A fundoscopic examination shows small red dots in the superficial retinal layers suggestive of microaneurysms. The HbA1c is 9% and the urinalysis shows the following:\nColor Pale yellow (light/pale-to-dark/deep amber)\nClarity Cloudy\npH 6.6\nSpecific gravity 1.010\nGlucose 199 mg/dl\nKetones None\nNitrites Negative\nLeukocyte esterase Negative\nBilirubin Negative\nUrinary bilirubin Traces\nRed blood cells 3 RBCs\nProtein 120 mg/d\nRBCs ≤ 2 RBCs/hpf\nWBCs 22 WBCs/hpf\nEpithelial cells 27 squamous epithelial cells/hpf\nCasts 5 hyaline casts/lpf\nCrystals Occasional\nBacteria None\nYeast Present\nWhich of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?",
    "options": {
      "A": "There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules",
      "B": "Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules",
      "C": "There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules",
      "D": "Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B (Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules): The patient in question is a case of secondary glucosuria. In secondary glucosuria, the renal tubular transporters are unable to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules due to a higher concentration of glucose in the filtrate than can be reabsorbed. This is usually due to a high concentration of glucose in the blood entering the glomerulus. This is in contrast to primary glucosuria where the glomerular membrane is permeable to glucose and glucose is spilled into the urine due to a defect in the glomerular membrane.\n\nThe patient in question has diabetes mellitus. In diabetes mellitus, the plasma glucose concentration is elevated and hence the glomerular filtrate also has a higher concentration of glucose. The secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules leading to glucosuria.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules.\n\nOption D is incorrect because glucosuria results from an increased glomerular filtration rate in diabetes mellitus and not from a disruption of passive transport of glucose in the renal tubules.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the renal tubular transporters are unable to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules due to a higher concentration of glucose in the filtrate than can be reabsorbed. This is usually due to a high concentration of glucose in the blood entering the glomerulus. This is in contrast to primary glucosuria where the glomerular membrane is permeable to glucose and glucose is spilled into the urine due to a defect in the glomerular membrane.\n\nThe correct answer is B (Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules).\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
