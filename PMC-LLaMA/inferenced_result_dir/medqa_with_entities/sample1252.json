    "question": "A 66-year-old man with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes presents to the clinic with elevated liver function tests from baseline. He has a blood pressure of 136/92 mm Hg and a heart rate of 69/min. On physical examination, his heart sounds are regular and lung sounds are clear. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, fenofibrate, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, glyburide, and lisinopril. Of these medications, which could contribute to the patient’s transaminitis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Metformin",
      "B": "Simvastatin",
      "C": "Glyburide",
      "D": "Lisinopril"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s liver function tests are significantly elevated. Simvastatin is a statin medication used to lower cholesterol. Although simvastatin is not typically associated with liver injury, it is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. It is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not typically cause liver injury. Glyburide is an oral hypoglycemic agent that is metabolized to an active metabolite that is excreted in the urine. Glyburide has been associated with hepatotoxicity. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used to treat hypertension. It is not typically associated with liver injury.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
