    "question": "A 36-year-old man presents to his physician for a regular checkup, and he expresses an intent to quit smoking. He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption.",
      "B": "Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products.",
      "C": "Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.",
      "D": "The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct statement is A. Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is effective in smoking cessation. It is not a nicotine replacement product. It works by reducing the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. It is not known to lower the seizure threshold, therefore it can be used in patients with a history of seizure disorder. A full cardiac workup is not necessary prior to starting bupropion therapy. Omeprazole is a microsomal enzyme inhibitor, and it can interfere with the metabolism of bupropion. Therefore, omeprazole should be taken one hour prior to the administration of bupropion.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
