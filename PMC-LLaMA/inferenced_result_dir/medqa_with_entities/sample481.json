    "question": "Current recommendations state that a single hemoglobin A1c value of greater than 6.5% is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. If this 6.5% cut-off is to be increased to 7.0%, which of the following would be true?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increase in false negative test results",
      "B": "Increase in false positive test results",
      "C": "Decrease in true negative test results",
      "D": "Increase in true positive test results"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "If the cut-off for diagnosing diabetes mellitus is increased from 6.5% to 7.0%, there would be a decrease in true positive test results. This is because an increase in the cut-off value means that a higher value is required to classify a patient as diabetic. Consequently, patients who previously tested positive at 6.5% would now test negative at 7.0%. Therefore, there would be a decrease in true positive test results. There would be no change in false negative, false positive, true negative, or false positive test results.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
