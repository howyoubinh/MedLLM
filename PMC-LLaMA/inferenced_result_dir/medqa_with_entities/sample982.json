    "question": "A 55-year-old male visited his primary care physician complaining of chest pain and progressive shortness of breath worsened by exertion. His vital signs were within normal limits. He reports that he worked in a naval shipyard for 10 years during his twenties. A CT scan of his chest shows diffuse thickening of the pleura and a diagnosis of mesothelioma is made. Assuming this diagnosis is correct, which of the following is most likely to also be present in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Pneumothorax",
      "B": "Pleural effusion",

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an inflammatory response that affects the whole body. It is not a complication of asbestos exposure. Bronchioalveolar carcinoma is a type of lung cancer. It is not a complication of asbestos exposure.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
