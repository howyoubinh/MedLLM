    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with crushing chest pain (10/10 in severity), radiating to the left side of the neck and the left arm. His symptoms started 20 minutes ago while shaving. He also feels nauseated, lightheaded and short of breath. He has had type 2 diabetes for 27 years and essential hypertension for 19 years. He has smoked 20–30 cigarettes per day for the past 35 years. Family history is irrelevant. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), the blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg and the pulse is 107/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. ECG is shown in the image. Troponins are elevated. The patient is admitted to a unit with continuous cardiac monitoring. Aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, and morphine are given immediately and the patient now rates the pain as 4–5 out of 10. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Percutaneous coronary intervention",
      "B": "Intravenous alteplase",
      "C": "Coronary artery bypass graft",
      "D": "Oral ramipril"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, diagnostic of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and elevated cardiac biomarkers make primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) the treatment of choice. Intravenous alteplase is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, not acute coronary syndromes. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is typically reserved for patients with multivessel disease or left main coronary artery disease, which is not suggested by the ECG. Oral ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
