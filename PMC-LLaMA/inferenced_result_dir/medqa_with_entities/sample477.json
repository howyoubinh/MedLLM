    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of a tingling sensation in his right forearm. He reports that his symptoms started after he lifted heavy weights at the gym. Physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm. Sensation over the thumb is intact. Range of motion of the neck is normal. His symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show weakness of which of the following actions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Elbow flexion",
      "B": "Forearm pronation",
      "C": "Index finger flexion",
      "D": "Wrist extension"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a radial nerve palsy. The radial nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, so a palsy results in weakness of forearm extension. The nerve also innervates the extensor carpi radialis longus, which produces wrist extension. The nerve is responsible for the sensory loss over the posterior surface of the arm and forearm. The muscles of forearm pronation are innervated by the median nerve. The muscles responsible for flexion at the elbow are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. The flexor digitorum profundus, responsible for flexion of the index finger, is innervated by the ulnar nerve.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
