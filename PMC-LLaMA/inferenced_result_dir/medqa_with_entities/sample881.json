He was recently diagnosed with stage 3 embryonal carcinoma testicular cancer. Following an orchiectomy, he was placed on chemotherapy. Cardiopulmonary examination shows fine inspiratory crackles bilaterally. There is clubbing present in the fingers bilaterally. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show FVC is 78% of expected and FEV1/FVC ratio is 92%. A CT scan of the chest is shown. Which of the following drugs is responsible for the patient’s condition?",

The patient was most likely treated with bleomycin, which is known to cause pulmonary fibrosis.
