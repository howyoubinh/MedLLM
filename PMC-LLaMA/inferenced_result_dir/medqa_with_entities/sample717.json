    "question": "Two hours after admission to the hospital for dialysis, a 63-year-old woman has severe pain in her lower back. The pain is 8 out of 10 in intensity and radiates down the legs. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She lives with her daughter and reports frequent fights with her at home. Her current medications include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/94 mm Hg. There is severe tenderness on palpation over the L2 vertebra; range of motion is limited. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 10.1 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 8,700/mm3\nPlatelet count 130,000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 136 mEq/L\nCl- 101 mEq/L\nK+ 5.1 mEq/L\nCalcium 8.2 mg/dL\nUrea nitrogen 33 mg/dL\nGlucose 190 mg/dL\nCreatinine 3.8 mg/dL\nAn x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tertiary hyperparathyroidism",
      "B": "Secondary hyperparathyroidism",
      "C": "Elder abuse",
      "D": "Primary hyperparathyroidism"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The markedly elevated serum calcium concentration in the setting of chronic kidney disease is diagnostic of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The hypercalcemia leads to deposition of calcium in the vascular bed, kidney, and periarticular tissues. The resulting vascular and kidney damage exacerbates the hypercalcemia and leads to the formation of kidney stones and vascular calcifications. The wedge compression fracture is a manifestation of vascular calcification. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is ruled out because the patient has evidence of kidney disease. Primary hyperparathyroidism is ruled out because the patient has evidence of chronic kidney disease. Elder abuse would not cause the constellation of findings seen in this patient.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
