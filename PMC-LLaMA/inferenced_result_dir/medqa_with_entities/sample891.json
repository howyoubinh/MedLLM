    "question": "A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 26 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department because of frequent contractions. The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Allow vaginal delivery",
      "B": "Initiate misoprostol therapy",
      "C": "Initiate nifedipine therapy",
      "D": "Perform dilation and evacuation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Option A is not appropriate because the patient has a history of a previous cesarean section. Vaginal birth after cesarean is not recommended in patients who have had a previous cesarean section. Option B is not appropriate because the patient is not an appropriate candidate for prostaglandin therapy. She has a contraindication to misoprostol because she has a history of an ulcer. Option C is not appropriate because nifedipine is not recommended for patients with a history of a previous cesarean section. It is not recommended to use nifedipine in patients with a history of a previous cesarean section. Option D is not appropriate because dilatation and evacuation is not recommended for patients with a history of a previous cesarean section.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
