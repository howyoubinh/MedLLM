    "question": "A previously healthy 29-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 35 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. Current medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. A rectovaginal swab culture grows bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Abstain from breastfeeding",
      "B": "Administer ampicillin intrapartum",
      "C": "Perform amniocentesis at 37 weeks",
      "D": "Administer intravenous immune globulin postpartum"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has group B streptococcus (GBS) infection. The best way to decrease vertical transmission is to give intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) to the mother at 35 to 37 weeks. The patient should be warned that there is still a 20% chance of vertical transmission despite IVIG. There is no evidence that cesarean section is beneficial in this situation. Ampicillin given intrapartum is effective in treating GBS, but will not decrease vertical transmission. Breastfeeding has not been shown to increase the risk of GBS in the newborn.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
