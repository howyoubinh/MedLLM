    "question": "A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of shortness of breath, double vision, and fatigue for the past 4 weeks. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Physical examination shows drooping of the eyelids bilaterally. He is unable to hold his arms up for longer than 3 minutes. A CT scan of the chest shows an anterior mediastinal mass with smooth contours. A photomicrograph of a specimen from the mass is shown. Which of the following immunologic processes normally occurs in the region indicated by the arrow?",
    "options": {
      "A": "B-cell maturation",
      "B": "V(D)J recombination",
      "C": "Thymocyte formation",
      "D": "Negative selection"
    }

  "model_response": "This patient has myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease that results from antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor at the myoneural junction. The thymus is hyperplastic in this disease. The CT scan shows a thymoma, which is a tumor of thymic epithelial cells. The photomicrograph shows the coex of the thymus, where T cells undergo maturation and selection. B cells mature in the bone marrow. V(D)J recombination occurs in immature B cells in the bone marrow. Thymocyte formation occurs in the thymus. Negative selection of T cells occurs in the thymus.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
