    "question": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because she had unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend the previous day. She has had regular menses since menarche at the age of 12. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She has no history of serious illness but is allergic to certain jewelry and metal alloys. She takes no medications. A urine pregnancy test is negative. She does not wish to become pregnant until she finishes college in six months. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Insert copper-containing intra-uterine device",
      "B": "Administer mifepristone",
      "C": "Administer ulipristal acetate",
      "D": "Administer depot medroxyprogesterone acetate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient should be given a copper-containing intra-uterine device (IUD) as the most effective form of emergency contraception. Emergency contraception is indicated in this patient because she had unprotected intercourse and wishes to avoid pregnancy until she finishes college. The copper-containing IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception and can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse. It can be used as a regular method of birth control and can be inserted up to 2 weeks after the start of menses. Mifepristone and ulipristal acetate are effective for emergency contraception but are more expensive and not as widely available as the copper-containing IUD. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is not an effective form of emergency contraception.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
