    "question": "A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 35 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in labor. She has no history of serious medical illness. She has had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Her last ultrasound at 22 weeks' gestation was normal. On admission, fetal heartbeats cannot be detected by fetal doppler monitor. Ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid levels and no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The patient gives birth to a 2296 g (5 lb 1 oz) male infant. Physical examination shows no signs of life. There are no visible malformations. The placenta is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Perform karyotyping of amniotic fluid",
      "B": "Recommend autopsy of the infant",
      "C": "Obtain photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI",
      "D": "Obtain consent for parental genetic testing"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Perform karyotyping of amniotic fluid. This is a case of a late fetal demise. The diagnosis of a chromosomal abnormality is the most common cause of a late fetal demise. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform karyotyping of amniotic fluid to look for a chromosomal abnormality. If a chromosomal abnormality is detected, the parents may benefit from genetic counseling. Autopsy of the infant is usually not indicated. Obtaining photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI is not necessary in this case. Obtaining consent for parental genetic testing is not indicated because a chromosomal abnormality in the parents would most likely be detected by karyotyping of amniotic fluid.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
