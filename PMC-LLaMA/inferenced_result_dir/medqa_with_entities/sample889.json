    "question": "A 23-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth for the past week. Although he has had gum bleeding in the past, it has never been this severe. He has no family history available as he was adopted. He does not have any significant past medical history. His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:\nPlatelet count 330,000/mm3\nBleeding time 6 mins\nProthrombin time 12 sec\nActivated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec\nFactor VIII activity decreased\nRistocetin cofactor assay decreased\nHe is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Gp Ib",
      "B": "Factor XI",
      "C": "Vitamin K",
      "D": "Antithrombin III"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a decreased factor VIII activity and decreased ristocetin cofactor activity. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder of blood clotting that results in spontaneous bleeding, paicularly into joints, muscles, and internal organs and easy brusing. It is caused by a deficiency of factor VIII. Factor VIII is involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which requires activation by thrombin. Thrombin is generated by the conversion of prothrombin, which is negatively regulated by antithrombin III. Vitamin K is required for the post-translational carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as protein C and S. Gp Ib is a glycoprotein that is a component of the platelet Gp Ib/IX receptor, which binds to von Willebrand factor. Factor XI is a serine protease that is activated by thrombin in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
