    "question": "A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of diarrhea and abdominal bloating. His stools are bulky, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. Over the past 6 months, he has had recurrent dull epigastric pain that is triggered by meals and lasts for a few days. He drinks 6 to 8 beers daily. Abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound or guarding. A CT scan of the abdomen is shown. The structure indicated by the arrows is most likely lined by which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Simple ductal epithelium",
      "B": "Granulation tissue",
      "C": "Pyogenic membrane",
      "D": "Columnar mucinous epithelium"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The CT scan shows a collection of fluid in the lesser sac. The structure indicated by the arrows is the lesser omentum, which has protruded into the lesser sac to form a \"curtain\" between the stomach and the new fluid-filled space. The lesser omentum is lined by simple ductal epithelium. A granulation tissue forms when healing occurs after an insult. A pyogenic membrane is a pseudocapsule that forms around a liver abscess. The stomach is lined by columnar mucinous epithelium.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
