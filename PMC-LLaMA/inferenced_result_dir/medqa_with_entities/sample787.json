    "question": "A 52-year-old man with Crohn disease comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of dysuria and urinary urgency. He had been treated for urinary tract infections twice in the past 6 months. He is currently taking infliximab. Cystoscopy shows pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall. Biopsy of these lesions shows a focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis. If the patient's bladder finding is caused by a vitamin deficiency, which of the following features is also most likely to be seen?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Carpopedal spasm",
      "B": "Photodermatitis",
      "C": "Night blindness",
      "D": "Intracranial hypertension"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has cicatricial pemphigoid, a rare autoimmune blistering disease that most often affects the eyes and oral mucosa. The bladder lesions are due to a side effect of the medication infliximab. The medication blocks tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which results in the loss of the normal TNF-mediated suppression of squamous epithelial growth in the bladder. The result is the development of squamous metaplasia and subsequent carcinoma in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The other choices are not features of vitamin A deficiency.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
