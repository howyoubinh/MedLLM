    "question": "A 54-year-old man comes to the clinic for management of his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is currently on cimetidine for his condition and reports that his GERD initially improved. However, following his recent move to Michigan, he is experiencing more frequent episodes of chest pain (4-5 times a week). The pain is described as burning in quality and is concentrated around his epigastric region following food ingestion. It does not radiate anywhere and is alleviated when he takes antacids. A physical examination demonstrates a healthy male with unremarkable findings. He is subsequently prescribed a new medication for control of his symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism of action of this new medication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase enzyme",
      "B": "Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells",
      "C": "Reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells",
      "D": "Reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is currently experiencing acid reflux disease, which is being managed with a histamine H2 receptor antagonist. These medications (such as ranitidine) block the action of histamine on H2 receptors at parietal cells, thus inhibiting the release of gastric acid. PGE1 analogues (such as misoprostol) work by increasing the prostaglandin concentration in the stomach. This results in increased mucus production, which acts as a physical barrier to protect the gastric epithelium from acid and pepsin. PGE1 analogues also increase the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter, thus preventing acid reflux. Cimetidine is an H1 receptor antagonist that is used to treat GERD. It works by decreasing the concentration of histamine at H1 receptors on parietal cells, thus inhibiting the release of gastric acid. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that irreversibly inhibits the H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells. This results in decreased acid production.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
