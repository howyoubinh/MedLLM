    "question": "A 17-year-old football player with no significant past medical history, social history, or family history presents to his pediatrician with itching in his groin. He says this started during summer workouts leading up to this season. He denies having any rash anywhere else on his body. The blood pressure is 123/78 mm Hg, pulse is 67/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and temperature is 38.1°C (98.7°F). Physical examination reveals an erythematous, well-demarcated patch with peripheral scale on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum. There is no apparent scrotal involvement with the rash. How can you confirm the suspected diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "KOH examination of lesion scrapings",
      "B": "Nikolsky's sign on physical exam",
      "C": "Gram stain of skin scrapings",
      "D": "AFB stain of skin scrapings"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B. Nikolsky's sign is present when the epidermis is dislodged from the dermis by lateral, shearing pressure with a finger, resulting in an erosion. This is seen in pemphigus vulgaris, which is a blistering disorder. This patient's rash is consistent with scabies, which is a mite infestation. KOH examination would show hyphae and pseudohyphae from the Candida infection. Gram stain would show gram-positive organisms, which would not be present in this case. AFB stain would be used to identify tuberculosis, which is not the correct diagnosis in this case.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
