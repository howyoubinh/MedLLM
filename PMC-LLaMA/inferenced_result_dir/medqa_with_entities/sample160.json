    "question": "A 5-year-old boy of African descent is presented to the emergency department by his parents. The child is clutching his abdomen and crying about pain in his belly. His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient’s spleen. Dysfunction of the zone marked with which number predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections?",

  "model_response": "The correct answer is D. The patient has sickle-cell disease, which affects the spleen and the RBCs. The spleen is responsible for clearing encapsulated bacteria (eg, pneumococcus, meningococcus, and H influenzae) from the blood. The spleen is also responsible for producing IgM antibodies. The lack of these functions predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections. The other choices are not related to the function of the spleen. Diagnosis: Sickle-cell disease\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
