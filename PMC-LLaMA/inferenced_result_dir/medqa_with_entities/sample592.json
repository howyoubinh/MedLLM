    "question": "A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue. He has a history of intravenous heroin use. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. A serum study is positive for hepatitis C RNA. Therapy with interferon-α is initiated in combination with a second drug. The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of which of the following enzymes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase",
      "B": "DNA-dependent RNA polymerase",
      "C": "DNA gyrase",
      "D": "Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The second drug added to the interferon-α is ribavirin, which inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, reducing the availability of guanosine triphosphate for viral RNA and protein synthesis. Ribavirin is used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. The other choices are not appropriate for treating hepatitis C.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
