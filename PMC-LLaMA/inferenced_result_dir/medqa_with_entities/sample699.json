    "question": "A 25-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of double vision. She first started seeing double after a long day at her work as a radiation technologist. Since then, her vision has appeared to worsen in the evenings. She has also felt worsening fatigue despite no change in her work hours or sleep habits. She has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and her most recent hemoglobin A1c was 7.4%. Her family history is notable for Sjogren’s syndrome in her mother and hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and carotid dissection in her father. Her temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 16/min. On examination, her pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Mild ptosis is noted bilaterally but worse on the left. A visual acuity test reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following medications is most appropriate in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Pyridostigmine",
      "B": "Physostigmine",
      "C": "Hydrocortisone",
      "D": "Azathioprine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms of diplopia and fatigue are due to hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves’ disease. The presence of mild ptosis, signs of sympathetic overactivity (tachycardia and hypertension), and a history of autoimmune disease (Sjogren’s syndrome) in her mother are all consistent with this diagnosis. The most appropriate treatment is to first control the hyperthyroidism with a beta-blocker (option C) and then immune suppression with azathioprine (option D).\n\nGraves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies to the TSH receptor stimulate the thyroid to produce excessive thyroid hormone. The most common presentation is with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including weight loss, tremor, anxiety, palpitations, and heat intolerance. In addition, Graves’ disease is associated with a variety of non-thyroidal manifestations, including autoimmune disorders (Sjogren’s syndrome, pernicious anemia, vitiligo), pseudogout, and ophthalmopathy. The ophthalmopathy of Graves’ disease is characterized by inflammation and edema of the extraocular muscles, leading to proptosis, double vision, and eye discomfort. The ophthalmopathy is usually symmetric and painless.\n\nThe diagnosis of Graves’ disease is confirmed by a high serum T4 level (normal T4 levels are shown below).\n\nThe first-line treatment for Graves’ disease is a beta-blocker to control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. This is followed by immunosuppression with azathioprine to prevent further immune damage to the thyroid. Radioactive iodine is also an effective treatment for Graves’ disease, but it is associated with a high incidence of permanent hypothyroidism. Therefore, it is generally reserved for older patients or those who do not respond to antithyroid medications.\n\nPyridostigmine and physostigmine are anticholinesterase medications that can be used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis, but they do not have a role in the treatment of Graves’ disease. Hydrocortisone is used in the treatment of adrenal insufficiency, which is not a feature of Graves’ disease.\n\nThe treatment of Graves’ ophthalmopathy is controversial. Some experts recommend treatment of active ophthalmopathy with corticosteroids, but others believe that corticosteroids are ineffective. In addition, the use of corticosteroids is associated with a high incidence of complications, including eye infections and glaucoma. Therefore, treatment of Graves’ ophthalmopathy is generally reserved for patients with severe or worsening symptoms.\n\nThe most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves’ disease, followed by toxic multinodular goiter and toxic adenomas. Primary hypothyroidism is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
