    "question": "A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for intermittent shaking of his hands. He reports that for the last several years he has noticed this \"shaking\" when he brushes his teeth and prepares a cup of coffee in the morning. The shaking then gradually improves over the course of the day. His past medical history is otherwise notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His only home medication is pravastatin. The patient smokes half a pack per day of cigarettes and drinks 2-3 beers throughout the day. His family history is significant for Parkinson disease in his father. On physical exam, his blood pressure is 159/84, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 12/min. He has a high frequency bilateral hand tremor elicited on finger-to-nose testing. His neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alprazolam",
      "B": "Primidone",
      "C": "Propranolol",
      "D": "Trihexyphenidyl"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's tremor is likely essential tremor, which is the most common movement disorder. It is characterized by a high-frequency tremor that is typically bilateral and symmetric. The tremor is most often noted in the hands, although it can also occur in the head, voice, and tongue. The differential diagnosis includes dystonic tremor, which is typically a low-frequency tremor that is also more prominent with targeted movements, and parkinsons disease, which is characterized by other findings such as bradykinesia and rigidity. The most common treatment for essential tremor is propranolol, typically in doses of 20-80 mg/day. Other therapies that have been used include primidone, alprazolam, gabapentin, and topiramate. Botulinum toxin injections have also been used with some success. There is no definitive surgical therapy for essential tremor.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
