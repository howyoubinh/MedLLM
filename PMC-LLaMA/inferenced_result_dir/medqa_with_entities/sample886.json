    "question": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine gynecological examination and to refill her birth control pills. Her last pap smear at age 22 showed no intraepithelial lesions nor malignancy of the cervical cells. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 4 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 75 years and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years. She mentions that she is planning a backpacking trip through Europe in 2 months. Her routine immunizations are all up-to-date. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F) and her blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Pelvic and speculum examination show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best recommendation for the patient at this time?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis screening",
      "B": "Beta-hCG urine test",

She is not sexually active with any person other than her partner, and she is not at risk for either gonorrhea or chlamydia. She is not pregnant, as she is not due for a menstrual period for 2 months. She is not due for a Pap smear, as she had one 2 years ago.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
