    "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his mother because of bruising on his torso and limbs. The patient’s mother denies any other symptoms and says he is otherwise healthy. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal. His coagulation profile reveals:\nProthrombin time (PT) 12 sec\nActivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 60 sec\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
      "B": "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura",
      "C": "Von Willebrand disease",
      "D": "Hemophilia A"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s laboratory results show a normal platelet count, normal PT, and prolonged aPTT. This pattern of results is consistent with hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder that results in a deficiency of factor VIII. The PT is normal because extrinsic coagulation, which is measured by the PT, is not affected. The aPTT is prolonged because the intrinsic coagulation pathway, which is measured by the aPTT, is affected. The platelet count is normal because platelet function is not affected.\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia can be ruled out because the patient’s complete blood count is normal. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis.\n\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura is associated with thrombocytopenia and a normal coagulation profile.\n\nVon Willebrand disease is associated with a deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which is not represented by the coagulation tests.\n\nHemophilia B is similar to hemophilia A, but the deficiency is in factor IX.\n\nHemophilia C is similar to hemophilia A and B, but the deficiency is in factor XI.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
