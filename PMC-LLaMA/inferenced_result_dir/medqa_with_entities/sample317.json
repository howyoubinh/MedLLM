    "question": "A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for an annual physical examination. He reports that his vision has progressively improved over the past 6 months and he no longer needs the glasses he used while driving. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, and enalapril. Examination shows 20/20 vision bilaterally. Fundoscopy shows a few microaneurysms of retinal vessels. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's improved vision?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Denaturation of lens protein",
      "B": "Liquefication of the vitreous body",
      "C": "Increased ciliary muscle tone",
      "D": "Increased lens elasticity"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Increased lens elasticity. As the lens ages, it tends to become more spherical, reducing its ability to change shape and bringing near objects into better focus. With increased lens elasticity, the lens can resume a more spherical shape, increasing the convergence of light rays and improving the image. This is why patients with cataracts have improved near vision before the lens becomes opaque.\n\nThe other choices are unrelated to improved vision in this patient. Denaturation of lens protein can lead to cataract formation. Liquefication of the vitreous body can lead to a decrease in visual acuity. Increased ciliary muscle tone can contribute to accommodation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
