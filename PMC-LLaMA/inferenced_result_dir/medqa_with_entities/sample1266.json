    "question": "A 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension presents to his primary care physician for an annual check-up. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He takes enalapril and metformin. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. His physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to the patient’s regimen. One month later, the patient returns to the physician complaining of new onset lower extremity swelling. Which of the following medications was likely prescribed to this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Metoprolol",
      "B": "Verapamil",
      "C": "Nifedipine",
      "D": "Hydrochlorthiazide"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient was most likely prescribed a calcium channel blocker (CCB) such as nifedipine. CCBs dilate the peripheral arterial tree and relax capacitance vessels, thereby decreasing total peripheral resistance and lowering blood pressure. However, the dilation of the peripheral arterial tree can promote the pooling of blood in the extremities, exacerbating peripheral edema. Patients with poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes are at high risk for diabetic kidney disease, which is associated with increased levels of proteinuria and decreased renal function. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are the first-line therapy for patients with diabetic kidney disease because they reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, these agents can cause acute kidney injury, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Therefore, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be used cautiously in patients with diabetic kidney disease, and other anti-hypertensive medications should be considered in these patients when additional blood pressure control is needed. Beta blockers, such as metoprolol, are often avoided in patients with diabetes because they can blunt the symptoms and physiologic response to hypoglycemia. Diuretics, such as hydrochlorthiazide, are often avoided in patients with diabetes because they can exacerbate hyperglycemia and promote the development of diabetic kidney disease.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
