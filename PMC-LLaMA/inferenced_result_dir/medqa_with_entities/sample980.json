    "question": "A 29-year-old G4P0 woman presents following a spontaneous pregnancy loss in the 18th week of her pregnancy. This is her fourth loss in the second trimester and she is concerned about her inability to have a successful pregnancy. She is otherwise healthy and has no acute complaints. Her vitals are unremarkable and exam is notable only for a firm, asymmetric uterus. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL\nHematocrit: 30%\nLeukocyte count: 6,800/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 199,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following tests is most likely to elucidate the cause of this patient's pregnancy losses?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Karotyping",
      "B": "Hysterosalpingogram",
      "C": "Prolactin level",
      "D": "TSH level"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A. Karotyping. This patient has a history of spontaneous pregnancy loss and is now presenting with a firm, asymmetric uterus. These findings raise concern for a possible uterine anomaly. The most common uterine anomaly associated with pregnancy loss is bicornuate uterus. Other anomalies that may be associated with pregnancy loss include septate uterus, unicornuate uterus, and diethylstilbestrol (DES) syndrome. All of these anomalies can be diagnosed by karyotyping. Karyotyping should be performed on any woman with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. Hysterosalpingogram, prolactin level, TSH level, and thyroidstimulating immunoglobulin level are not indicated in this patient.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
