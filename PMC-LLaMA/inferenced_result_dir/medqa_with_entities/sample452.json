    "question": "A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the chief complaint of a high fever for several days. In addition to the fever, he has had malaise, chest pain, and a dry cough. He recently went on vacation to South America but has returned to his job delivering packages. He has several friends who recently had influenza. Hi temperature is 102.8째F (39.3 째C), blood pressure is 137/80 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98%. Chest exam reveals a deep noise found bilaterally in the lung bases. Chest radiograph reveals a wider area of opacity near the heart and bilateral lung infiltrates. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cultured on charcoal and yeast",
      "B": "D-glutamate capsule",
      "C": "Found in desert sand",
      "D": "Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient most likely has Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by Legionella pneumophila. Legionella is a gram-negative rod that stains with difficulty. It is found in natural bodies of fresh water and can be concentrated by passing the water through charcoal. It can be isolated on routine laboratory media if the media are heated to 45째C (unlike Mycoplasma, Legionella grows better at 35째C). The organism has a D-glutamate capsule that prevents phagocytosis by WBCs. The organism can be identified by direct fluorescent antibody staining of respiratory secretions. Legionella can survive and multiply inside free-living amebas, which may be an important reservoir. The organism produces a toxin that is chemically similar to diphtheria toxin. The polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a virulence factor that protects it from phagocytosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that is found in moist environments, such as shower heads and sinks. It is a common cause of pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. It does not have a D-glutamate capsule or a polysaccharide capsule. It is a strict aerobe and does not grow on routine laboratory media if the carbon dioxide tension is not carefully controlled. It is often multidrug-resistant. Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative rod that is a common cause of pneumonia in patients with chronic lung disease. It does not have a D-glutamate capsule or a polysaccharide capsule. It is a strict aerobe and does not grow on routine laboratory media if the carbon dioxide tension is not carefully controlled. It is often multidrug-resistant. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a small pleomorphic rod that lacks a cell wall and is therefore not visible on Gram's stain. It is found in the throat of about half of all healthy adults, who carry the organism without symptoms. It is transmitted person to person via respiratory droplets. Mycoplasma causes atypical pneumonia, which is usually not severe. It does not have a D-glutamate capsule or a polysaccharide capsule.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

The islands were united under the rule of King Kamehameha 1795-1819 and requested annexation to the United States in 1893 when a provisional government was set up. Hawaii was established as a territory in 1900 and admitted as a state in 1959. The name is from the Polynesian Owhyhii, place of the gods, with reference to the two volcanoes Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, regarded as the abode of the gods.
