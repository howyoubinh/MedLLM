    "question": "A 17-year-old man presents to his family physician for an evaluation about the size of his penis. He feels increasingly anxious during physical education (PE) class as he has noticed that the size of his penis is significantly smaller when compared to his peers. Based on the physical examination, he is Tanner stage 1. The weight and height are 60 kg (132 lb) and 175 cm (5 ft 9 in), respectively. The cardiopulmonary examination is normal; however, the patient has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell. Which of the following explains the pathophysiology underlying this patient’s disorder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat",
      "B": "Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency",
      "C": "Sex-specific epigenetic imprinting",
      "D": "Non-disjunction of sex chromosomes"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has Kallmann syndrome, which is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia. Isolated GnRH deficiency is a cause of delayed puberty. The GnRH deficiency results in low levels of LH and FSH, which in turn leads to low levels of testosterone and estrogen. The patient has a Tanner stage 1, which is consistent with delayed puberty. The patient has a normal sense of smell, which is also consistent with Kallmann syndrome. The disorder is caused by an expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the X-linked KAL gene, which maps to Xp22.3. The KAL gene encodes anosmin-1, which is a neural adhesion molecule that promotes migration of GnRH neurons and olfactory neurons, from the olfactory placode into the hypothalamus during embryonic development. Anosmin-1 also functions as a neurite-promoting factor for GnRH neurons. The expansion of the CTG trinucleotide repeat in the KAL gene results in decreased production of anosmin-1, which in turn results in the failure of migration of GnRH neurons and olfactory neurons into the hypothalamus. The failure of GnRH neurons to migrate into the hypothalamus results in low levels of LH and FSH. The failure of olfactory neurons to migrate into the hypothalamus results in anosmia. Sex-specific epigenetic imprinting refers to the phenomenon whereby the expression of a gene depends on the parent of origin. This is not the case for Kallmann syndrome. Non-disjunction of sex chromosomes refers to the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during meiosis. This can result in conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) or Turner syndrome (45,XO). These conditions are associated with gonadal dysgenesis and not with the development of GnRH neurons.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
