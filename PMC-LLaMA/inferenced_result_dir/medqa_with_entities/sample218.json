    "question": "A 17-year-old female accidentally eats a granola bar manufactured on equipment that processes peanuts. She develops type I hypersensitivity-mediated histamine release, resulting in pruritic wheals on the skin. Which of the following layers of this patient's skin would demonstrate histologic changes on biopsy of her lesions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Stratum corneum",
      "B": "Stratum granulosum",

  "model_response": "The stratum corneum is the most superficial layer of the epidermis and is composed of terminally differentiated, dead keratinocytes known as corneocytes. The stratum granulosum is the layer immediately deep to the stratum corneum and is composed of flattened, enlarged keratinocytes. The stratum basale is the deepest layer of the epidermis and is composed of columnar, basophilic keratinocytes. The dermis is a fibrous connective tissue layer that lies deep to the epidermis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
