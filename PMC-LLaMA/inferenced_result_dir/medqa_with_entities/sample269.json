    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a 6-hour history of severe eye pain and blurry vision. He wears soft contact lenses and has not removed them for 2 days. Ophthalmologic examination shows a deep corneal ulcer, severe conjunctival injection, and purulent discharge on the right. Treatment with topical ciprofloxacin is initiated. A culture of the ocular discharge is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Gram-negative, non-maltose fermenting diplococci",
      "B": "Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacilli",
      "C": "Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli",
      "D": "Gram-positive, optochin-sensitive diplococci\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The history and clinical findings are typical of bacterial keratitis, which occurs in contact lens wearers who do not follow proper lens-disinfection procedures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common cause of keratitis in these patients. The organism is a gram-negative rod that ferments lactose but not maltose. It produces a blue-green, water-soluble pigment (pyocyanin) that diffuses into agar and is the basis for the name \"pseudomonas (false monad).\"\n\nOxidase-positive, gram-negative rods that oxidize maltose are the most likely cause of keratitis in a contact lens wearer. This group includes Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Klebsiella. Optochin-sensitive, gram-positive diplococci that ferment maltose are the most likely cause of keratitis in a contact lens wearer. This group includes Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Gram-negative, oxidase-positive rods that do not ferment lactose or maltose are unlikely to be pathogenic in this setting. This group includes Neisseria. Gram-positive, optochin-sensitive diplococci that ferment maltose are unlikely to be pathogenic in this setting. This group includes Corynebacterium.\n\nDiagnosis: Keratitis\n\n{A: Pseudomonas aeruginosa}\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
