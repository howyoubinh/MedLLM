    "question": "A 32-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 16-week gestation. A quadruple screening test shows maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median and normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Which of the following is most likely to account for these findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Partial molar pregnancy",
      "B": "Neural tube defect",
      "C": "Trisomy 18",
      "D": "Trisomy 21"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has an elevated maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level, which is associated with a number of fetal conditions. The four most common are neural tube defects, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18, and trisomy 13. The association of an elevated MSAFP level with a normal level of estriol suggests the diagnosis of trisomy 21. The level of hCG is not helpful in this case.\n\nThe quadruple screening test is a maternal blood test that is performed in the second trimester to screen for chromosomal abnormalities and neural tube defects. The test has four components: MSAFP, hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Each of the first three components are produced by the fetal liver, placenta, and yolk sac. Inhibin A is produced by the corpus luteum of the ovary. Each of the first three components are decreased in the presence of a trisomy. Inhibin A is increased in the presence of a trisomy.\n\nA partial molar pregnancy would be associated with an elevated hCG level and low levels of the other three components. A neural tube defect would be associated with an elevated hCG level and normal levels of the other three components. A trisomy 18 and a trisomy 13 would be associated with low levels of all four components.\n\nTrisomy 21 is the most common chromosomal abnormality found in patients with an elevated MSAFP level. Down syndrome occurs in 1 of 800 live births and is most commonly associated with trisomy 21 (47, XX+21). It is the most common chromosomal abnormality in the fetus after an abnormal quadruple screening test.\n\nNeural tube defects occur in 1 of 1000 live births. They are associated with maternal folic acid deficiency and are most common in the lumbosacral region. They are the most common fetal abnormality after an abnormal quadruple screening test.\n\nTrisomy 18 occurs in 1 of 5000 live births and is associated with decreased levels of all four components. Trisomy 13 occurs in 1 of 15,000 live births and is associated with decreased levels of all four components.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
