The patient is a known IV drug abuser but otherwise has an unknown past medical history. He currently attends a methadone clinic. His temperature is 99.5째F (37.5째C), blood pressure is 97/48 mmHg, pulse is 140/min, respirations are 29/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Initial laboratory values are shown below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 6.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 17 mEq/L\nGlucose: 589 mg/dL\n\nThe patient is given treatment. After treatment, his temperature is 99.5째F (37.5째C), blood pressure is 117/78 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. His laboratory values are seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 19 mEq/L\nGlucose: 90 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?",

His initial treatment should include insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and glucose. This will correct his hyperglycemia, improve his intravascular volume status, and correct his metabolic acidosis. His initial improvement is consistent with appropriate treatment. His subsequent laboratory values show that his acidosis has not fully corrected. His potassium level has improved, but his bicarbonate level has not. His acidosis is likely due to ongoing ketoacidosis. His treatment should be continued with insulin and potassium. His bicarbonate level will likely improve with time as his acidosis resolves. His glucose level should be rechecked in an hour and further adjustments in insulin made as needed. His IV fluids should be continued as needed. His improvement is likely due to appropriate treatment. His laboratory values show that his acidosis has not fully corrected.
