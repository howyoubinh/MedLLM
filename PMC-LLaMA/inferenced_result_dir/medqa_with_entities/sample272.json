    "question": "A 9-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of intermittent watery diarrhea for several months. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. He was diagnosed with eczematous dermatitis at 3 months old. His height and weight are below the 5th percentile. Immunologic evaluation shows a defect in activated regulatory T cells. A genetic analysis shows a mutation in the FOXP3 gene. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hemorrhagic diathesis",
      "B": "Ocular telangiectasias",
      "C": "Autoimmune endocrinopathy",
      "D": "Retained primary teeth"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has IPEX syndrome (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) which is caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene. The loss of function of regulatory T cells leads to autoimmune phenomena. The most common clinical manifestations are early-onset chronic diarrhea, autoimmune thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hemorrhagic diathesis is not a feature of IPEX syndrome. Ocular telangiectasias are a feature of ataxia telangiectasia. Autoimmune endocrinopathy can include adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and thyroiditis. Retained primary teeth are not a feature of IPEX syndrome.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
