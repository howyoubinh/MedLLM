    "question": "A 60-year-old man with a history of osteoarthritis has been awaiting hip replacement surgery for 3 years. During his annual physical, he reports that he has been taking over the counter pain medications, but that no amount of analgesics can relieve his constant pain. Laboratory results reveal that his renal function has deteriorated when compared to his last office visit 2 years ago. Serum creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, and urinalysis shows 1+ proteinuria. There are no abnormalities seen on microscopy of the urine. A renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration in renal function?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis",
      "B": "Ischemic acute tubular necrosis",
      "C": "Nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis",
      "D": "Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is D. This patient has developed toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis secondary to long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs can cause a variety of renal side effects, including acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, and papillary necrosis. The eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation seen on renal biopsy are consistent with a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. The other choices are not typically associated with NSAID use. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis can be seen in patients with HIV or sickle cell disease, but not typically in association with NSAIDs. Ischemic acute tubular necrosis is usually seen in patients with severe hypotension or volume depletion. Nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis is most commonly seen in patients with rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
