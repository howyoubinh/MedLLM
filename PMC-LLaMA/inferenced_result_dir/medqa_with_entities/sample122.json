    "question": "A 28-year-old gravida 1 at 32 weeks gestation is evaluated for an abnormal ultrasound that showed fetal microcephaly. Early in the 1st trimester, she had fevers and headaches for 1 week. She also experienced myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. The symptoms resolved without any medications. A week prior to her symptoms, she had traveled to Brazil where she spent most of the evenings hiking. She did not use any mosquito repellents. There is no personal or family history of chronic or congenital diseases. Medications include iron supplementation and a multivitamin. She received all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic agent?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dengue virus",
      "B": "Rubella virus",
      "C": "Toxoplasmosis",
      "D": "Zika virus"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The symptoms of fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and rash are consistent with dengue fever. The exposure to mosquitoes during hiking in Brazil raises the possibility of Zika virus infection. However, the negative IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis make this diagnosis unlikely. Rubella virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital malformations, but the symptoms of the mother during the 1st trimester are not consistent with rubella.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
