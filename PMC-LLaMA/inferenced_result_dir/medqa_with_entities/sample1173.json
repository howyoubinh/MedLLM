    "question": "A 53-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue and joint and muscle pain. He reports a 6-month history of slowly progressive tiredness associated with dull achy pain in his knees, hips, and shoulders. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina. He takes lisinopril, metformin, glyburide, and aspirin. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was homeless in his early 30’s. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a generally well-appearing male without evidence of ascites, peripheral edema, or jaundice. Results from laboratory tests are below:\n\nHepatitis A IgM: Negative\nHepatitis A IgG: Negative\nHepatitis B surface antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B E antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B core antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B surface IgG: Positive\nHepatitis B E IgG: Negative\nHepatitis B core IgG: Negative\nHepatitis C IgG: Positive\nHCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml\n\nThis patient should be started on which of the following medications?",

      "B": "Interferon-gamma",
      "C": "Ribavirin",

    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s laboratory results indicate that he is positive for hepatitis C antibody, indicating past exposure to the virus. The presence of active viral replication is demonstrated by the presence of a detectable HCV RNA viral load. The HCV RNA viral load is quantified in international units per milliliter (IU/ml). The genotype of the hepatitis C virus is not specified in the question. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir are direct-acting antiviral agents used to treat chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. Interferon-gamma is used to treat chronic hepatitis B and C infections. Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analog that inhibits viral RNA synthesis and is used to treat chronic hepatitis C infections. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analog that inhibits viral DNA synthesis and is used to treat chronic hepatitis B infections.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
