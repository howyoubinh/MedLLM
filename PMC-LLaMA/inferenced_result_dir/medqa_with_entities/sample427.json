    "question": "A 45-year-old African-American male presents to the family medicine physician to assess the status of his diabetes. After reviewing the laboratory tests, the physician decides to write the patient a prescription for miglitol and states that it must be taken with the first bite of the meal. Which of the following bonds will no longer be cleaved when the patient takes miglitol?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Phosphodiester bonds",
      "B": "Glycosidic bonds",
      "C": "Cystine bonds",
      "D": "Hydrogen bonds"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that reversibly and noncompetitively inhibits the enzymes in the brush border of the small intestine that are responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to simple carbohydrates. By inhibiting the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to simple carbohydrates, miglitol decreases the postprandial rise in plasma glucose levels. The phosphodiester bonds in the DNA double helix are cleaved during DNA replication. Cystine bonds are found in the keratin of nails and hair. Hydrogen bonds are found in the structure of DNA and RNA. Glycosidic bonds are found in carbohydrates.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

State-of-the-art reviews tend to address more current matters.
