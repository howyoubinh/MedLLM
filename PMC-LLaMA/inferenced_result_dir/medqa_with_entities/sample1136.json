    "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath for 1 month. He has been unable to practice with his recreational soccer team and has had to rest frequently when walking to work. His only medication is ibuprofen for joint pain. Physical examination shows tanned skin. There is tenderness to palpation and stiffness of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. Pulmonary examination shows coarse crackles in both lung fields. The liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing is most likely to be positive for which of the following?",

The most common variant of systemic sclerosis is the diffuse cutaneous form. The anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive in virtually all patients with systemic sclerosis. The HLA haplotypes most often associated with the disease are HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4. The other HLA haplotypes listed in the question are not associated with systemic sclerosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
