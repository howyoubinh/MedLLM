    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with intermittent chest pain. He reports a 2-month history of exertional chest pain that commonly arises after walking 5 or more blocks. He describes the pain as dull, burning, non-radiating substernal pain. His past medical history is notable for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He takes simvastatin and losartan. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. S1 and S2 are normal. No murmurs are noted. An exercise stress test is performed to further evaluate the patient’s pain. Which of the following substances is released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Adenosine",
      "B": "Inorganic phosphate",
      "C": "Prostaglandin E2",
      "D": "Transforming growth factor beta"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is adenosine. Adenosine is a nucleoside that is formed in the myocardium and released into the coronary circulation during periods of increased myocardial metabolism, such as during cardiac hypertrophy and during exercise. Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation by acting on specific adenosine receptors on coronary endothelial cells. Adenosine receptor activation leads to the production of NO and cyclic GMP, which causes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Adenosine is also a neurotransmitter in the brain. Inorganic phosphate is a substance that is released into the systemic circulation during periods of increased metabolism, such as during exercise. It is taken up by the liver and used to synthesize ATP. Prostaglandin E2 is a substance that is released by the cyclooxygenase pathway and is involved in inflammation and pain. Transforming growth factor beta is a substance that is released by cardiac myocytes and is involved in cell growth and differentiation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
