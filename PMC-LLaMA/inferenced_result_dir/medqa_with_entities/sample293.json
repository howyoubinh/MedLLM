    "question": "An 8-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with respiratory distress, facial edema, and a skin rash after eating a buffet dinner with her family. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery, has met all developmental milestones and is fully vaccinated. Past medical history is significant for mild allergies to pet dander and ragweed, as well as a severe peanut allergy. She also has asthma. She normally carries both an emergency inhaler and EpiPen but forgot them today. Family history is noncontributory. The vital signs include: blood pressure 112/87 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical examination, the patient has severe edema over her face and an audible stridor in both lungs. Of the following options, which is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "IM epinephrine",
      "B": "oral diphenhydramine",
      "C": "extra-strength topical diphenhydramine",
      "D": "inhaled sodium cromolyn - mast cell stabilizer"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'R': '1. IM epinephrine', 'S': '2. Oral diphenhydramine', 'T': '3. Extra-strength topical diphenhydramine', 'U': '4. Inhaled sodium cromolyn - mast cell stabilizer'}[?]The correct answer is R: IM epinephrine. This patient is experiencing an anaphylactic reaction with severe angioedema and stridor. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that must be recognized and managed promptly. It is a potentially fatal condition that requires immediate treatment. The onset may be rapid and the symptoms may progress to respiratory distress, cardiovascular collapse, and death if not treated. Epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis. It is given in a concentration of 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) via intramuscular or subcutaneous route. The onset of action is usually within minutes, and the effect lasts for 2-10 hours. The most common adverse effects are transient palpitations, anxiety, and hypertension. The patient should be monitored for recurrence of symptoms for at least 6-8 hours after resolution of symptoms following epinephrine administration. The patient should be given oral antihistamines and corticosteroids after the initial dose of epinephrine. The patient should also be given a prescription for a 3-day course of oral antihistamines and a short course of oral corticosteroids. The patient should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation and consideration of immune desensitization. The patient should be educated about the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms recur. The patient should wear a Medic Alert bracelet and be instructed to avoid known allergens. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a biphasic response and the need to seek medical attention even if symptoms resolve initially. The biphasic response occurs when symptoms reappear after initial resolution. The second phase is usually less severe than the initial phase. The patient should be instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms recur. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a late phase response, which can occur 8-12 hours after the initial reaction. The patient should be instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a systemic reaction if the allergen comes in contact with the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. The patient should be instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms develop. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a severe reaction with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if she has a history of allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs. The patient should be instructed to avoid NSAIDs and seek medical attention if symptoms develop. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a severe reaction with the use of contrast dye if she has a history of allergic reactions to contrast dye. The patient should be instructed to inform her health care provider about her allergy history prior to the use of contrast dye. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a severe reaction with the use of local anesthetics if she has a history of allergic reactions to local anesthetics. The patient should be instructed to inform her health care provider about her allergy history prior to the use of local anesthetics. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a severe reaction with the use of latex if she has a history of allergic reactions to latex. The patient should be instructed to inform her health care provider about her allergy history prior to the use of latex products. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a severe reaction with the use of seminal fluid if she has a history of allergic reactions to seminal fluid. The patient should be instructed to inform her health care provider about her allergy history prior to sexual activity. The patient should also be educated about the possibility of a severe reaction with the use of foods if she has a history of allergic reactions to foods. The patient should be instructed to avoid the offending foods and inform her health care provider about her allergy history prior to the use of foods. The patient should also be educated",
