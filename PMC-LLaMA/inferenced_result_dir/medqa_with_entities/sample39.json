    "question": "A 67-year-old male is seen by neurology after he was noticed to be speaking strangely by his family. After acute treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the patient is able to recover most of his speech. Subsequent neurologic exam finds that the patient is fluent while speaking and is able to comprehend both one and two step instructions. Noticeably the patient remains unable to complete tasks involving verbal repetition. Residual damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's syndrome?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Arcuate fasciculus",
      "B": "Superior temporal gyrus",
      "C": "Inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus",
      "D": "Arcuate fasciculus + inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is suffering from Wernicke's aphasia, which is caused by damage to the superior temporal gyrus and/or inferior frontal gyrus. This is most often due to a stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by fluent speech with impaired comprehension and inability to repeat. The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract that connects Broca's area (inferior frontal gyrus) to Wernicke's area (superior temporal gyrus). Damage to this structure would result in a non-fluent Broca's aphasia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
