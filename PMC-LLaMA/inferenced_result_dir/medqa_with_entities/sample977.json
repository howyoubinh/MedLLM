  "model_response": "This patient's lesions are most consistent with seborrheic keratosis. These are benign growths that can appear at any age but are more common in older individuals. They are usually multiple, vary in size, and can be peaked or flat. They are usually stuck on the skin and can be removed by a curette or by light cryotherapy. The other lesions listed are not stuck on the skin and are usually solitary.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
