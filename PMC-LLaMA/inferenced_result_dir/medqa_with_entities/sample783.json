    "question": "A 3-year-old male is brought by his mother to the pediatrician's office. The mother and child are refugees from Somalia and arrived in the United States one week ago. They were recently placed in temporary housing. The mother reports that the child has been chronically tired and subdued since before their arrival in the United States. The child was born at 38 weeks gestation with the help of a local midwife. The child’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 105/60 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a listless child with a rotund abdomen and positive fluid wave. Notable lower extremity edema is present. This patient's condition is most likely caused by a deficiency in which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Total caloric intake",
      "B": "Relative protein intake",
      "C": "Relative carbohydrate intake",
      "D": "Relative fat intake"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's condition is most likely caused by protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). The relative protein deficiency (low protein to calorie ratio) is the most common form of malnutrition seen in developing countries. PEM is characterized by failure to gain weight and/or length. In addition, the child may exhibit edema, which is a result of hypoalbuminemia. The edema may be generalized or localized to the face, ankles, and abdomen. The abdomen may be rotund due to hepatomegaly and ascites. The fluid wave may be present due to ascites. The child may also have a decreased immunocompetence, which increases the risk of infectious disease. The other choices are not associated with the development of PEM.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
