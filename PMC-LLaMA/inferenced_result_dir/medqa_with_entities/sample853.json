    "question": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police after he was found undressing himself outside in 110°F weather. The patient refuses to answer any questions as he suspects that his care team is spying on him. The patient recently started college and has presented to the emergency department once before for polysubstance intoxication. The patient attempts to assault a nurse, is restrained, and given diphenhydramine and haloperidol. When the patient is able to be examined, he is somnolent and non-responsive. His temperature is 104°F (40°C), blood pressure is 147/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He does not comply with any commands, and it is not possible to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity. His mucous membranes are dry. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Catatonic schizophrenia",
      "B": "Heat stroke",
      "C": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome",
      "D": "Oversedation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's history of undressing himself in hot weather, somnolence, non-responsiveness, rigidity, and elevated temperature and blood pressure are consistent with a diagnosis of exertional heat stroke. Exertional heat stroke is a medical emergency that can result in death if not treated appropriately. It is most commonly seen in young, physically fit individuals who overexert themselves in hot or humid weather. The body's thermoregulatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, leading to hyperthermia, which can cause disorientation, incoordination, and eventually loss of consciousness. Heat stroke can be distinguished from heat exhaustion and heat cramps by the presence of elevated core body temperature (>40°C or 104°F) and altered mental status. Treatment consists of immediate cooling measures, including ice packs and cooling blankets, as well as supportive care. Catatonic schizophrenia is characterized by a marked disturbance of motor behavior, which can include negativism, posturing, and mutism. The patient's history does not suggest a diagnosis of catatonic schizophrenia. Heat stroke can cause muscle rigidity, but the patient's history of undressing himself in hot weather and the other findings on physical examination are more consistent with exertional heat stroke. Heat stroke can cause oversedation, but the patient's history of undressing himself in hot weather and the other findings on physical examination are more consistent with exertional heat stroke. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially life-threatening reaction to neuroleptic medications that is characterized by hyperthermia, rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic dysregulation. The patient's history of undressing himself in hot weather and the other findings on physical examination are more consistent with exertional heat stroke.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
