    "question": "A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department for evaluation of hemoptysis. A chest X-ray reveals bilateral focal pulmonary consolidation. On further questioning, he admits having hematuria. Urinalysis shows RBC casts and 400 mL of urine is excreted in 24 hours. What is the most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Anti-Smith antibodies",
      "B": "Anti-neutrophil antibodies",
      "C": "Anti-mitochondrial antibodies",
      "D": "Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's presentation is most consistent with Goodpasture syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis. The disease is caused by antibodies directed against the noncollagenous domain of the a3 chain of collagen IV. These antibodies can be detected in the serum of more than 90% of patients with Goodpasture syndrome. Anti-Smith antibodies are seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are seen in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies are seen in patients with anti-glomerular basement disease.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
