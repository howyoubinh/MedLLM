    "question": "An otherwise healthy 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of pain and swelling of her right knee joint and left wrist. She went camping with her new boyfriend 3 weeks ago but does not recall any tick bites. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F). Examination of the right knee shows swelling, warmth, and tenderness on passive movement. There is a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 8 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 45,000/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils with intracellular organisms). Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?",
