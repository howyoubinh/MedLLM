    "question": "Eight weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication, a 43-year-old woman with obesity comes to the physician because of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. She also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision. She has had no fever, chills, or vomiting. Physical examination shows dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release",
      "B": "Inhibition of serotonin reuptake",
      "C": "Stimulation of norepinephrine release",
      "D": "Inhibition of lipase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This woman's symptoms are characteristic of a drug-induced hypoglycemic coma. The most common drugs that cause hypoglycemia are the sulfonylureas, such as chlorpropamide and tolbutamide. These drugs stimulate insulin release from the pancreas. The most common adverse effects of sulfonylureas are nausea and hypoglycemia. The most serious adverse effect is hypoglycemic coma. This is more likely to occur in elderly individuals, in whom a single dose of a sulfonylurea may induce a prolonged and serious hypoglycemia. The other listed choices are not related to hypoglycemia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
