    "question": "A previously healthy 67-year-old man comes to the physician for routine health maintenance evaluation. He works at a community center and volunteers at a local homeless shelter. A tuberculin skin test shows an induration of 14 mm. An x-ray of the chest is normal. Treatment with an antimycobacterial drug is initiated. Two months later, he has numbness and burning over both feet and an unsteady gait. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patientâ€™s current symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine",
      "B": "Intracellular accumulation of sorbitol",
      "C": "Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons",
      "D": "Impaired breakdown of glucose to ATP"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has developed a peripheral neuropathy as a result of isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency. Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, which is necessary for the formation of pyridoxal phosphate, an essential cofactor in the metabolism of tryptophan and synthesis of niacin. In individuals with marginal nutritional status, isoniazid may lead to a deficiency of pyridoxine and the development of a peripheral neuropathy due to the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and increased activity of the enzyme 5-hydroxytryptophan dehydrogenase. The neuropathy is usually reversible with pyridoxine supplementation. The other choices are not related to isoniazid or pyridoxine deficiency.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
