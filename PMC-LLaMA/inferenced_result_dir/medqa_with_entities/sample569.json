    "question": "A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. He was at a college party exhibiting belligerent behavior when he suddenly passed out and fell to the ground. His past medical history is not known. His temperature is 100째F (37.8째C), blood pressure is 107/48 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is covered with emesis and responds incoherently to questions. As the patient begins to wake up he continues vomiting. The patient is started on IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics and begins to feel better. Thirty minutes later the patient presents with muscle rigidity and is no longer responding coherently to questions. His temperature is 103째F (39.4째C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's basic laboratory studies are drawn and he is started on IV fluids, given lorazepam, and placed under a cooling blanket. Despite these initial measures, his symptoms persist. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
