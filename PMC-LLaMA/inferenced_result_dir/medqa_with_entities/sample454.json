    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to a neurologist for evaluation of severe headache. He started experiencing episodic headaches and palpitations 3 months ago; however, he thought that these symptoms were simply related to the stress of moving and starting a new job. He has continued to experience these intermittent headaches and has also noticed that he sweats profusely during these episodes. On presentation his temperature is 99.1°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 163/112 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical exam reveals pallor and perspiration but is otherwise unremarkable. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is produced by cells located in which region of the histology slide shown in figure A?",

      "A": "A",
      "B": "B",
      "C": "C",
      "D": "E"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is D. The patient's symptoms are most likely caused by a pheochromocytoma, a tumor derived from chromaffin cells. These cells are located in the adrenal medulla and are capable of secreting catecholamines, which can result in paroxysmal hypertension, headache, palpitations, and profuse sweating. The histology slide shows normal adrenal cortex, which is composed of lipid-laden cells that are arranged in a clear, sharply demarcated zone between the cortex and the underlying medulla. The adrenal medulla is composed of dark-staining cells that are polygonal and arranged in a characteristic \"zellballen\" pattern. These cells are the chromaffin cells, which secrete catecholamines. The other cells listed are not typically found in the adrenal medulla. Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
