    "question": "A 16-year-old male presents to his pediatrician with complaints of malaise, fatigue, sore throat, and fever over the last several days. His vital signs are as follows: T 39.1 C, HR 82, BP 122/76, RR 14, and SpO2 99%. Physical examination is significant for splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy. The tonsils are not notably enlarged. Laboratory work-up shows an elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and a positive heterophile antibody screen. Which of the following is the best management of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bed rest and activity limitation",
      "B": "Ganciclovir",
      "C": "Amoxicillin",
      "D": "Prednisone"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has infectious mononucleosis, which is most commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The heterophile antibody screening test is positive in more than 90% of cases. The mainstay of treatment is bed rest and activity limitation during the early stages, when the sore throat and cervical lymphadenopathy are most prominent. Amoxicillin or other antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of bacterial superinfection. Ganciclovir is an antiviral agent with in vitro activity against EBV; however, it is not used clinically for the treatment of infectious mononucleosis. Patients with infectious mononucleosis should avoid contact sports for at least 3 weeks to avoid splenic rupture. Corticosteroids have not been shown to have a role in the treatment of infectious mononucleosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
