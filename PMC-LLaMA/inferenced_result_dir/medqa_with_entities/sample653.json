    "question": "A 45-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband due to upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past couple of hours. She had similar episodes in the past, which were often precipitated by food but resolved spontaneously. Her temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F), heart rate is 96/min, blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals tenderness over the right upper quadrant that is severe enough to make her stop breathing when deeply palpated in the area. Lab results show:\nLeukocyte count 18,000/mm3 with 79% neutrophils\nAspartate aminotransferase 67 IU/L\nAlanine aminotransferase 71 IU/L\nSerum amylase 46 U/L\nSerum Lipase 55 U/L\nSerum calcium 8.9 mg/dL\nUltrasonography of the abdomen is shown below. During the ultrasound exam, the patient complains of tenderness when the probe presses down on her right upper quadrant. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her pain?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acute calculous cholecystitis",
      "B": "Acute acalculous cholecystitis",
      "C": "Acute pancreatitis",
      "D": "Ascending cholangitis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ultrasound shows a distended gallbladder with thickened walls and pericholecystic fluid. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and tenderness on physical examination are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis. The sonographic findings of a distended gallbladder with thickened walls and pericholecystic fluid are also consistent with this diagnosis. The other choices are not consistent with the clinical and sonographic findings.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
