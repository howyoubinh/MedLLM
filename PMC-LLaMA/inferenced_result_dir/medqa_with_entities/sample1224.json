    "question": "A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for pain in his back. The patient describes the pain as feeling worse in the morning. He says it is a general stiffness that improves when he goes to the gym and lifts weights. He also states that his symptoms seem to improve when he leans forward or when he is cycling. The patient is a current smoker and is sexually active. He admits to having unprotected sex with many different partners this past year. The patient has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. On physical exam, the patient demonstrates notable kyphosis of the thoracic spine and decreased mobility of the back in all 4 directions. The patient’s strength is 5/5 in his upper and lower extremities. The rest of his physical exam is within normal limits. Which of the following findings is associated with this patient’s presentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Diminished pulses in the lower extremity",
      "B": "Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright",
      "C": "Pain with elevation of his leg while laying down",
      "D": "Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s presentation is most consistent with ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the axial skeleton. It most commonly affects the sacroiliac joints and the spinal column. The patient’s symptoms of pain and stiffness in the back are worse in the morning and improve with physical activity. The kyphotic deformity of the spine is characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. The patient’s age, sex, and smoking history are all risk factors for ankylosing spondylitis. The patient’s symptoms of pain with elevation of his leg while laying down is called a positive Gower’s sign and is indicative of extra-articular disease. The other choices are not associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Diminished pulses in the lower extremity would suggest vascular disease. Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright would suggest spinal stenosis. Pain with passive range of motion of the hip would suggest hip pathology. Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed would suggest vasculitis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
