    "question": "Three days after induction chemotherapy, a 9-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital for fever and neutropenia. He was initially diagnosed with t(9;22)-positive acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia following workup for fatigue and pancytopenia. He is fully conscious. His blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination including examination of the central venous catheter site shows no source of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Which of the following factors about this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Age",
      "B": "Cytogenetics",
      "C": "Fever and neutropenia",
      "D": "Initial presentation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Age, cytogenetics, and presentation at diagnosis have all been shown to be significant prognostic factors in pediatric ALL. Age is the single best answer of exclusion. Children younger than 1 year of age do very poorly, whereas older children have a better prognosis. Cytogenetics can predict for prognosis, with t(12;21) being good and t(9;22) being very bad. Presentation at diagnosis can also predict for prognosis, with those presenting in remission having a better prognosis. Fever and neutropenia, on the other hand, are worrisome for infection in a patient with immunosuppression due to chemotherapy. Infection in the setting of neutropenia is a very bad prognostic sign.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
