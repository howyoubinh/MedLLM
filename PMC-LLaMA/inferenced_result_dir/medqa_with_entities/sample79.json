    "question": "A 25-year-old male involved in a knife fight presents with a penetrating wound to the chest. The patient is unconscious and cannot provide any further history. Vitals show a temperature of 37-0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, pulse of 115/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Immediate cardiac transplant",
      "B": "Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated",
      "C": "Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets",
      "D": "Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is in extremis and requires immediate surgery. The patient has a full thickness injury to the right ventricle, which is the most rapidly fatal cardiac injury. The patient is also in shock, which further supports the need for immediate surgery. The patient will require open cardiac massage to maintain cardiac output while the injury is being repaired. The definitive surgical approach will require a full sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. A needle thoracostomy is performed in the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line for emergency decompression of the hemithorax in a patient in shock with a suspected cardiac injury. A cardiac transplant is not an option.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
