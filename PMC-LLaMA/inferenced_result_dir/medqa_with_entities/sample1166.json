    "question": "A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of worsening grades over the past year. Since she started high school one year ago, her academic performance has decreased. She also has had difficulty finding friends at the new school. She is afraid that her classmates will make fun of her and think that she is “stupid.” One month ago, when she had to give a presentation, she could not stop wondering how her classmates were going to react if she said something wrong. During the presentation, her heart started racing and she became flushed. Since this event, she avoids saying anything in class. She spends her breaks in the restroom because she is worried that nobody will talk to her. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the girl avoids eye contact and appears uncomfortable and anxious. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Clomipramine",
      "B": "Phenelzine",
      "C": "Fluoxetine",
      "D": "Propranolol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The girl's history is suggestive of social anxiety disorder. The most effective pharmacotherapy for this condition is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Fluoxetine is a good choice because it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children. Clomipramine is also an effective antianxiety agent but is not approved by the FDA for use in children. Propranolol is a beta blocker that is sometimes used to decrease the physiologic symptoms of anxiety (e.g., tremor, palpitations, sweating). However, it is not a first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that is also used to treat anxiety disorders. However, because of dietary restrictions and potential drug interactions, MAOIs are usually reserved for treatment-resistant patients.\n\n###COMMENT: Clomipramine is effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, because it has not been shown to be effective in children and adolescents with OCD, it is not a first-line treatment for this condition in this age group.\n\n###COMMENT: Propranolol is used to decrease the physiologic symptoms of anxiety (e.g., tremor, palpitations, sweating). However, it is not a first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder.\n\n###COMMENT: MAOIs are usually reserved for treatment-resistant patients because of dietary restrictions and potential drug interactions.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
