    "question": "A 15-year-old woman presents with fever, altered mental status and a petechial rash on her lower extremities and back since yesterday evening. She also says she has been nauseous for the past 3 hours and has vomited twice. The patient mentions she has had heavy menstrual bleeding for the past few days. Her blood pressure is 95/80 mm Hg and her temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F). On physical examination, the patient appears diaphoretic. A pelvic examination reveals a tampon in her vagina. Binding and activation of which of the following T cell receptors is responsible for this patient’s most likely condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "B7 receptor",
      "B": "Variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor",
      "C": "CD3",
      "D": "IgCAM"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is Option C, CD3. This patient’s presentation is most consistent with toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a febrile illness characterized by multisystem involvement, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. It is associated with infection of the skin, mucosa, or other sites by toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-producing Staphylococcus aureus. TSS typically occurs in menstruating women who use vaginal tampons. The tampon provides a site for bacterial growth, and the presence of the tampon may inhibit the normal clearance of bacteria from the vagina. TSS results from the binding and activation of the CD3 receptor on T cells by the variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor. The binding of the T cell receptor to the MHC-II molecule on the antigen-presenting cell results in the activation of the B7 receptor. The IgCAM is a cell adhesion molecule that binds to immunoglobulins and is not involved in the pathogenesis of TSS.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
