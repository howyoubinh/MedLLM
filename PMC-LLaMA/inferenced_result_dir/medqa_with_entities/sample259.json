    "question": "A 23-year-old woman is referred to a genetic counselor. She is feeling well but is concerned because her brother was recently diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. All first-degree relatives were encouraged to undergo genetic screening for any mutations associated with the disease. Today, she denies fever, chills, joint pain, or skin hyperpigmentation. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 123/78 mm Hg. Her physical examination is normal. Her serum iron, hemoglobin, ferritin, and AST and ALT concentrations are normal. Gene screening will involve a blood specimen. Which of the following genes would suggest hereditary hemochromatosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "BCR-ABL gene",
      "B": "BRCA gene",
      "C": "FA gene",
      "D": "HFE gene"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The HFE gene is located on chromosome 6. A mutation in this gene is responsible for 85% of cases of hereditary hemochromatosis. The BCR-ABL gene is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The BRCA gene is associated with breast cancer. The FA gene is associated with Fanconi anemia. The NF1 gene is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
