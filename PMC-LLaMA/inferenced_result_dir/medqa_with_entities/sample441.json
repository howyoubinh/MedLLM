    "question": "A 40-year-old female presents to your office complaining of a tender neck and general lethargy. Upon further questioning, she reports decreased appetite, fatigue, constipation, and jaw pain. Her pulse is 60 bpm and her blood pressure is 130/110 mm Hg. Biopsy of her thyroid reveals granulomatous inflammation and multinucleate giant cells surrounding fragmented colloid. Which of the following likely precipitated the patient’s condition:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Iodine deficiency",
      "B": "Thryoglossal duct cyst",
      "C": "Infection",
      "D": "Chronic renal disease"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has subacute thyroiditis, which is thought to be caused by a viral infection. The initial insult is an inflammatory process that causes follicular destruction and release of thyroid hormone. The resultant hyperthyroidism causes the symptoms of anxiety, palpitations, and sweating. The destruction of the follicles also releases excess colloid, which can be seen as enlarged, multinucleate, hyperplastic follicles on biopsy. The hyperthyroidism is followed by a phase of hypothyroidism as the inflammation causes follicular destruction and the thyroid gland is unable to secrete sufficient thyroid hormone. The hypothyroidism is followed by a return to normal thyroid function.\n\nIodine deficiency can cause endemic goiter, which is characterized by diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland. Thyroglossal duct cysts are congenital cysts that occur in the midline of the neck. They are characterized by a cystic swelling that moves upward with swallowing and notably with tongue protrusion. Infection of the thyroid gland can cause an abscess or acute suppurative thyroiditis. Chronic renal disease can cause secondary hyperparathyroidism, but does not typically cause thyroiditis.\n\nSubacute thyroiditis is also known as granulomatous or de Quervain thyroiditis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
