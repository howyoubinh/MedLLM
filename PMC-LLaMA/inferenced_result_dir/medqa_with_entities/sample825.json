    "question": "A 16-year-old female presents to her physician’s office after noticing a round lump in her left breast 2 months ago. She reports that the lump seemed to enlarge and became tender just preceding her last 2 menses. It is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. She has no past medical history but her grandmother, age 72, was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The patient is an avid softball player at her high school and denies alcohol, smoking, or illicit drug use. On exam, the breasts appear symmetric and normal. A 3-cm round, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is slight tenderness to deep palpation of the mass. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "This mass will decrease in size if the patient starts oral contraceptives",
      "B": "This mass slightly increases this patient’s risk of breast cancer in the future",
      "C": "This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time",
      "D": "If this mass grows rapidly to greater than 5 cm, radiation and chemotherapy are indicated"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely outcome of this patient’s condition is that the mass will decrease in size or disappear over time. The patient’s age and the description of the mass make fibroadenoma the most likely diagnosis. Fibroadenomas are benign tumors that are frequently seen in adolescents and young adults. They are firm, mobile masses that are well-circumscribed and usually do not cause pain. Fibroadenomas do not increase the risk of breast cancer, but the family history of breast cancer in this patient is concerning. The patient should be reassured that the mass is benign and that the risk of breast cancer is not increased. The patient should be counseled to perform monthly breast self-exams and to return for follow-up if there is any change in the size or characteristics of the mass.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
