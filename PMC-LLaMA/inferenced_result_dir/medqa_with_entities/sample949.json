    "question": "A 61-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of a productive cough and worsening shortness of breath. He has had frequent episodes of a productive cough over the past 3 years. He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 1 year ago. He appears distressed. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse wheezes and coarse crackles. A chest x-ray shows increased lung lucency bilaterally and flattening of the diaphragm. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Prednisone and albuterol",
      "B": "Albuterol and montelukast",
      "C": "Prednisone and tiotropium",
      "D": "Albuterol and theophylline"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's clinical presentation suggests acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy is oxygen and a short-acting bronchodilator. The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is below the threshold at which supplemental oxygen should be administered (oxygen saturation less than 94%), so oxygen therapy is warranted. Short-acting bronchodilators provide immediate relief of symptoms and can be used as needed. The combination of a glucocorticoid and a long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium) is recommended for patients who have frequent exacerbations. The combination of a glucocorticoid and a long-acting beta2 -agonist (e.g., albuterol) is recommended for patients who have severe COPD. Theophylline is not recommended as a first-line therapy for COPD.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
