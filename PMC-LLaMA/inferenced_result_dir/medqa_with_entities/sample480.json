    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her father for evaluation. He is concerned that she has not undergone puberty yet, while all of her classmates at school have. The patient herself feels well overall, with no specific complaints. Examination shows vital signs of T 98.9, HR 71, and BP 137/92. The physician notes undeveloped breasts and normal external and internal female genitalia in Tanner I stage of development. Her body mass index is within normal limits, she is in the 40th percentile for height, and she is agreeable and pleasant during the interview. Which of the following additional findings is likely present in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Aromatase enzyme deficiency",
      "B": "Hypokalemia",
      "C": "XY karyotype",
      "D": "Hypercortisolism"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has constitutional delay of puberty. This is a diagnosis of exclusion, and no laboratory or imaging studies are necessary. The patient should be reassured that she will likely begin puberty within the normal age range. Aromatase enzyme deficiency would lead to increased androgen levels, which would lead to virilization. Hypokalemia would lead to weakness and/or polyuria. An XY karyotype would lead to ambiguous genitalia. Hypercortisolism would lead to weight gain, hypertension, and/or bruising.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
