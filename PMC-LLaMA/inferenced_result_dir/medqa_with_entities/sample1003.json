    "question": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and a weight loss of 4 kg (8.8 lb) over the last 4 months. She has recently avoided drinking alcohol and eating spicy food because it worsens her diarrhea and causes episodes of heart palpitations and reddening of the face and neck. She takes lisinopril for hypertension. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 149/90 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft, and there is mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show an increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration. Further evaluation of this patient will most likely show which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Achlorhydria",
      "B": "Adrenal medullary mass",
      "C": "Multiple peptic ulcers",
      "D": "Pulmonic valve stenosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has the carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by increased levels of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid. The syndrome occurs in 67% of patients with carcinoid tumors. The most common site of origin for these tumors is the appendix. The syndrome is caused by vasoactive substances (e.g., serotonin) produced by the tumors. The syndrome is characterized by attacks of flushing, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and bronchospasm. Cardiac involvement can include endocardial fibrosis, pulmonary stenosis, and tricuspid insufficiency. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating increased urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
