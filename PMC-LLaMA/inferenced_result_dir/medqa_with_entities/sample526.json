    "question": "A 81-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he fell asleep at the dinner table and was not able to be roused by his family. His past medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease though he is still relatively functional at baseline. He has also been taking warfarin over the last 3 months after he suffered a deep venous thrombosis. After he was transported to the ED, his family found that the pills his grandson takes for seizures were missing. On presentation, he is found to be somnolent and physical exam reveals ataxia and nystagmus. After determining the cause of this patient's symptoms, his physicians begin monitoring his international normalized ratio, because they are concerned that it will start trending down. Which of the following treatments would most improve the urinary excretion of the substance likely responsible for these symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ammonium chloride",
      "B": "Mannitol",
      "C": "Sodium bicarbonate",
      "D": "Thiazide diuretics"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with warfarin toxicity. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is required for the regeneration of active vitamin K. Vitamin K is necessary for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on factors 2, 7, 9, and 10. The effect of warfarin is not usually apparent until at least 50% of the activity of these factors is decreased. The INR is a measure of the prothrombin time, which is an indirect measure of factor 2 activity. Ammonium chloride is sometimes used to induce a metabolic alkalosis in patients with barbiturate or salicylate toxicity. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is sometimes used to reduce intracranial pressure. Sodium bicarbonate is sometimes used to treat patients with drug-induced hyperkalemia. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes used to treat patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
