    "question": "A 25-year-old male is hospitalized for acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. His parents report that he has been experiencing flu-like symptoms for one week prior to hospital admission. Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges",
      "B": "Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons",
      "C": "Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia",
      "D": "Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is suffering from rabies, which is caused by the neurotropic virus of the Rhabdoviridae family. The rabies virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of a rabid animal, typically a dog or various wild mammals. The virus initially replicates in striated and connective tissue at the site of inoculation. It then spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) via hematogenous and neural spread. Once in the CNS, the virus replicates in the gray matter and then migrates to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) via retrograde axonal transport. PNS viral replication and the associated neurologic disease occur in an ascending pattern, leading to severe neurologic dysfunction, including agitation, hydrophobia, and paralysis. Without treatment, death usually occurs within 1 week after onset of symptoms.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
