  "original_data": {
    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness and a 13.6 kg (30 lb) weight loss. He is a vegetarian. The patient’s family says that he had been high functioning but has had significant behavioral changes over the past year. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol consumption, or illicit drug use. No significant family history. His vital signs include: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg without postural changes, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉). Physical examination reveals a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin man. He is irritable, paranoid, and delusional but denies any hallucinations. An unstable, wide-based ataxic gait is noted. Laboratory results are significant for the following:\nHb 6.1 g/dL\nMCV 109 fL\nPlatelets 90,0000/mm3\nTotal count 3,000/mm3\nReticulocyte count 0.8%\nA peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?\n ",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypothyroidism",
      "B": "Folate deficiency",
      "C": "Vitamin B12 deficiency",
      "D": "Parvovirus infection"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s low vitamin B12 level is most likely due to pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease in which the gastric mucosa is gradually destroyed and vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed. The patient’s low hemoglobin, MCV, and reticulocyte count are consistent with anemia. The peripheral blood smear is significant for hypersegmented neutrophils, which are characteristic of vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient’s neurological symptoms are also consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\nHypothyroidism, folate deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, and parvovirus infection can all cause anemia. However, the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood smear is specific for vitamin B12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia is associated with the presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, but this test was negative in this patient.\n\nThe patient’s vegetarian diet and weight loss are risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia is more common in patients with northern European ancestry.\n\nTreatment with vitamin B12 supplementation should be initiated. The patient should also be evaluated for a possible B19 parvovirus infection, which can also cause anemia, but this is less likely given the patient’s negative parvovirus IgG antibody test.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
