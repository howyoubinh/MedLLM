    "question": "A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after collapsing at the grocery store and losing consciousness for 1 minute following a sudden onset of palpitations. He has no chest pain or dizziness. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is currently being treated as an outpatient for pneumonia. His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and azithromycin. He has no sign of injury, and he appears well. During the examination, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypomagnesemia",
      "B": "Brugada syndrome",
      "C": "Prolonged QT interval",
      "D": "Hyperkalemia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Hypomagnesemia is a common finding in patients with inadequate oral intake, chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, or increased renal excretion. It is also associated with alcoholism and acute pancreatitis. Hypomagnesemia is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death. The patient's syncope is likely due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is a known complication of hypomagnesemia. Brugada syndrome is characterized by syncopal episodes and sudden cardiac death due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. However, this syndrome is associated with a structurally normal heart. The patient's history of hypertension and coronary artery disease increases the likelihood of ischemic heart disease, which can lead to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. However, this is less likely to be the cause of his syncope in the absence of chest pain or dizziness. Prolonged QT interval is a cause of syncope due to torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. However, this is less likely in this patient because his arrhythmia has alternating QRS axis, which is a characteristic of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Hyperkalemia can cause syncope due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. However, this is less likely in this patient because he has no sign of injury, and he appears well.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
