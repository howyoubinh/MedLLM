    "question": "A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Binds complement proteins on the cell surface",
      "B": "Binds endogenous peptides that are present in the endosome",
      "C": "Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel",
      "D": "Binds exogenous peptides that are present in the endosome"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The primary function of the protein that was identified is binding endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel. The protein is most likely CD8, which is a heterodimer composed of an alpha and a beta chain. The alpha chain binds to MHC class I molecules, and the beta chain binds to CD8. The beta chain also binds to the TAP proteins that transport peptides from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum. The other choices are incorrect because they do not describe the function of the CD8/TAP protein interaction.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Fluorescence provides a quantitative measure of various biochemical and biophysical properties of the cell, as well as a basis for cell sorting. Other measurable optical parameters include light absorption and light scattering, the latter being applicable to the measurement of cell size, shape, density, granularity, and stain uptake."
