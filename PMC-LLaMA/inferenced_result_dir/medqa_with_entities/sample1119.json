    "question": "An obese 42-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a complaint of left knee pain for the past 3 months. She describes the pain as affecting the inside part of the knee as well as the front of her knee, below the kneecap. She denies any inciting injury or trauma to the knee but reports that the pain is worse when she is climbing up stairs or rising from a chair. Physical examination is significant for localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line. There is no joint effusion noted. Valgus stress testing is negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint. Radiographs of the left knee are obtained and reveal only mild arthritis, without evidence of any fractures or bony lesions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Stress fracture of proximal tibia",
      "B": "Medial meniscus tear",
      "C": "Medical collateral ligament (MCL) sprain",
      "D": "Pes anserine bursitis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is pes anserine bursitis. The pes anserine bursa is located on the medial aspect of the knee, just below the tibial plateau and separates the conjoined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus from the tibia. Pes anserine bursitis is a common cause of knee pain in obese patients, especially those who are \"weekend warriors\" or who have recently begun an exercise program. The pain is usually exacerbated by climbing stairs or rising from a chair, as these activities increase the pressure on the bursa. The physical examination findings of localized tenderness to palpation and the characteristic location of the bursa are consistent with this diagnosis. Stress fractures of the tibia typically present with localized pain aggravated by weight-bearing activities such as walking or climbing stairs. The physical examination findings of localized tenderness to palpation and the characteristic location of the bursa are not consistent with this diagnosis. Medial meniscus tear is unlikely in this patient because the pain is not exacerbated by valgus stress testing. The physical examination findings of localized tenderness to palpation and the characteristic location of the bursa are not consistent with this diagnosis. MCL sprain is unlikely in this patient because the pain is not exacerbated by valgus stress testing. The physical examination findings of localized tenderness to palpation and the characteristic location of the bursa are not consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
