    "question": "A 65-year-old woman schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of weight loss and weakness. The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair. The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy",
      "B": "Hypothyroidism",
      "C": "Myasthenia gravis",
      "D": "Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The symptoms of weakness and fatigue that improve with exercise and the finding of bladder incontinence point to the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The differential diagnosis includes a number of disorders that affect neuromuscular transmission. These include the autoimmune disorder myasthenia gravis, the toxic syndrome botulism, and the congenital syndrome Lambe-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Botulism is associated with a descending paralysis and does not improve with exercise. LEMS improves with exercise and is associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a childhood disease. Hypothyroidism is associated with fatigue and weight gain.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
