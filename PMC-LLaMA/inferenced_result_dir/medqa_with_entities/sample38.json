    "question": "A 53-year-old man with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma is enrolled in a clinical trial for a novel chemotherapeutic agent that his physician believes may be beneficial to his condition. The novel drug was previously tested in a small population and is now undergoing a larger phase 3 trial in preparation for FDA approval. A dose-response trial had the following results:\n\n10 mg dose - 6/59 patients demonstrated improvement\n20 mg dose - 19/49 patients demonstrated improvement\n30 mg dose - 26/53 patients demonstrated improvement\n40 mg dose - 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement\n\nThe same trial also had the following safety profile:\n\n20 mg dose - 5/49 patients had a treatment related adverse event\n40 mg dose - 11/51 patients had a treatment related adverse event\n60 mg dose - 15/42 patients had a treatment related adverse event\n80 mg dose - 23/47 patients had a treatment related adverse event\n100 mg dose - 47/52 patients had a treatment related adverse event\n\nBased on this study, which of the following represents the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent?",

  "model_response": "The therapeutic index is calculated as the ratio of the median lethal dose (LD50) to the median effective dose (ED50). The LD50 is the dose that will kill half the subjects, and the ED50 is the dose that will have a positive effect in half the subjects. In this case, the LD50 is calculated as 100/47 = 2.13, and the ED50 is calculated as 40/26 = 1.54. Therefore, the therapeutic index is calculated as 2.13/1.54 = 1.38 or 1.4.\n\n###OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
