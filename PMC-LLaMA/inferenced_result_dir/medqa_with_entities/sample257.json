    "question": "A routine newborn screening test for phenylketonuria in a male neonate shows a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL (N < 20). He is started on a special diet and the hyperphenylalaninemia resolves. At a routine well-child examination 4 months later, the physician notices that he has persistent head lag. On examination, he has blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia. His serum prolactin level is markedly elevated. Supplementation of which of the following substances is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tyrosine",
      "B": "Pyridoxine",
      "C": "Thiamine",
      "D": "Tetrahydrobiopterin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has type I tyrosinemia, which is due to a deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. The accumulation of fumarylacetoacetate and its metabolites leads to liver and kidney damage, and may cause mental retardation. The main pathway affected is the tyrosine degradation pathway, which produces the pigment melanin. This explains the blue eyes, pale skin, and blonde hair. The main metabolite of phenylalanine is tyrosine, so phenylalanine accumulates and leads to the inhibition of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to a high level of serum phenylalanine. The high serum phenylalanine also inhibits the enzyme tyrosine transaminase, which leads to a low level of serum tyrosine. The low serum tyrosine leads to low synthesis of melanin, which explains the albinism. The high serum phenylalanine also stimulates the release of the pituitary hormone prolactin, which explains the persistent head lag and the elevated serum prolactin level. Supplementation with niacin, a precursor of NAD, which is required for the synthesis of melanin, will prevent further complications. Pyridoxine, thiamine, and tetrahydrobiopterin are all cofactors required for tyrosine degradation, but their deficiencies do not lead to the symptoms described.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
