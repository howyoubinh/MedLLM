    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely inciting factor for this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased carbohydrate intake",
      "B": "Increased tryptophan intake",
      "C": "Medication change",
      "D": "Surreptitious opiate abuse"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s presentation is most consistent with serotonin syndrome. The syndrome is characterized by altered mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and hyperthermia. The syndrome can occur with therapeutic use of serotonergic medications or with ingestion of serotonin-elevating substances such as certain herbal supplements, antidepressants, and opiates. The inciting factor in this case is the change in medication from paroxetine to citalopram. Both medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but the potency of citalopram is significantly less than paroxetine. The change in medication is likely to have caused an increase in serotonergic activity, leading to serotonin syndrome. The syndrome is also likely worsened by her increased carbohydrate intake and weight loss, as both are associated with increased tryptophan intake. Tryptophan is a precursor in the synthesis of serotonin. Decreased carbohydrate intake and weight loss can lead to increased tryptophan intake and subsequently increased serotonin production. The syndrome can occur in individuals who abuse illicit drugs such as ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; MDMA), which acts to increase serotonergic activity. The syndrome is also associated with surreptitious opiate abuse, as certain opiates (such as meperidine and tramadol) can increase serotonergic activity. The syndrome is not associated with overdose of citalopram, as the medication has a very large therapeutic index and significant overdose would be required to cause serotonin syndrome.\n\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
