    "question": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because he has excessively dry skin. His mother says that he has had dry, scaly skin since he was 6 months old. She says it is worse in winter and better in summer. There is no associated itching, redness, or discharge. Examination reveals generalized fine scales with coarse skin all over the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae (see image). There are multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Psoriasis",
      "B": "Lichen simplex",
      "C": "Ichthyosis vulgaris",
      "D": "Pityriasis versicolor"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is C (Ichthyosis vulgaris). The presence of fine scales with coarse skin, absence of itching or redness, darkening of the palmar and plantar creases and the presence of multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles (keratotic papules) suggest a diagnosis of Ichthyosis vulgaris.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
