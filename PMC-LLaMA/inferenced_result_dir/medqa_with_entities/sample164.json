    "question": "A 70-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of back pain. For the past six days, she has had a burning pain in her upper right back and chest. She cannot recall any recent injury and has no prior history of back pain. She has a history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux. The patient volunteers at an animal shelter three times a week. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include ramipril and pantoprazole. The patient appears healthy and well nourished. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.42°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. Examination shows a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions extending from her back to below her right breast. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of the disease?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia",
      "B": "IgA deposits in the upper dermis",
      "C": "Bacterial lymphatic infection of the epidermis",
      "D": "Infestation with bloodsucking parasites"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has shingles, or herpes zoster. Reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia produces this characteristic rash. The virus travels the sensory nerve to the skin. The rash is characteristically in a dermatomal distribution. The vesicles are filled with virus, and the crust is made up of cell debris. The other choices do not describe shingles.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
