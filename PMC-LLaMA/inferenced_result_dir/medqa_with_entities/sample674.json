    "question": "An experimental new drug in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 was found to increase the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increased glucose-dependent insulin production. Which of the following drugs has a mechanism of action most similar to this new experimental drug?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sitagliptin",
      "B": "Glimepiride",
      "C": "Canagliflozin",

    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'A': 'Sitagliptin', 'B': 'Glimepiride', 'C': 'Canagliflozin', 'D': 'Pioglitazone'}[?]Incretins are peptides released from the gastrointestinal tract in response to nutrient ingestion. They then act on the pancreas to cause an increase in insulin secretion. Two important incretins are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). GLP-1 has a number of effects that increase insulin secretion, including closing potassium channels, opening calcium channels, and increasing the sensitivity of the pancreatic b cells to glucose. It is normally rapidly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidly peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that prevents the degradation of GLP-1, thus increasing the levels of GLP-1 and the insulin response.Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that acts by stimulating insulin secretion.Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotranspo-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor that inhibits glucose reabsorption in the kidney, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion.Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that acts by decreasing insulin resistance.</s><s>",
