    "question": "A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:\nHemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL\nHematocrit 43.2 %\nWhite blood cells 14,500 /mm3\nPlatelets 312,000/mm3\nNeutrophil 81.6%\nLymphocyte 15.2%\nMonocyte 1.4%\nEosinophil 1.2%\nBasophil 0.6%\nSerum Na+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.3 mEq/L\nCl- 108 mmol/L\nBUN 12 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cefepime",
      "B": "Cefotaxime",
      "C": "Amoxicillin",
      "D": "Cephalexin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms of vertigo, hearing loss, and the presence of a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane are consistent with acute otitis media. The elevated white blood cell count with left shift is indicative of an acute infection. The patient's use of mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, is of note. This medication can lead to immunosuppression and may have contributed to the development of the infection. The most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient is Cefepime. The patient's normal renal function and lack of significant electrolyte abnormalities make aminoglycosides a good choice. Cefotaxime and cephalexin are also good choices, but they do not provide the broad coverage of Cefepime. Amoxicillin would not be a good choice because of the patient's history of recurrent otitis media and the presence of a bulging tympanic membrane. The patient should be treated with the antibiotic for 7-10 days.\n\n###Suggested Reading:\n\nOtitis Media\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Jerk nystagmus has a slow phase in one direction followed by a corrective fast phase in the opposite direction, and is usually caused by central or peripheral vestibular dysfunction. Pendular nystagmus features oscillations that are of equal velocity in both directions and this condition is often associated with visual loss early in life.
