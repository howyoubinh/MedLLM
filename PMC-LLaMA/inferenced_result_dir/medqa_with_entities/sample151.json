    "question": "A transvaginal ultrasound shows an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid. Both the ovaries are enlarged and have multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the ovarian findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chocolate cysts",
      "B": "Corpus luteum cysts",
      "C": "Yolk sac tumor",
      "D": "Theca leutein cysts"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ovarian findings are suggestive of a theca leutein cyst. Theca leutein cysts are multiple, thin-walled, unilocular or multiloculated cysts containing clear fluid. They are usually bilateral and are associated with gestational trophoblastic disease, such as hydatidiform mole, or with choriocarcinoma.\n\nChocolate cysts are cystic areas of the endometrioma containing blood, endometrial glands, and hemorrhages.\n\nCorpus luteum cysts are usually unilateral and are found at the time of menstruation or during early pregnancy. They are usually single and contain clear fluid with occasional blood.\n\nYolk sac tumor is a rare ovarian tumor that is usually found in young women. It is composed of cells that resemble the yolk sac, allantois, and extraembryonic, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells.\n\nTheca leutein cysts are associated with gestational trophoblastic disease, such as hydatidiform mole, or with choriocarcinoma.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
