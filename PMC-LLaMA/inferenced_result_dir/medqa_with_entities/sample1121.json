    "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of periodic painful double vision for 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus",
      "B": "Compressive tumor of the pons",
      "C": "Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency",
      "D": "Infarction of the brainstem"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A (Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus). The patient's symptoms are most consistent with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) which is most commonly due to demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) in the brainstem. The MLF connects the cranial nerve VI (abducens) nucleus on each side with the contralateral cranial nerve III (occulomotor) nucleus. The MLF mediates the adduction of the eye ipsilateral to the abducens nucleus of origin of the abducens nerve and the contralateral eye by the occulomotor nucleus. Thus, a lesion of the MLF results in ipsilateral loss of adduction and contralateral loss of ipsilateral gaze. The patient's history of myopia and corrective lenses, her recent fall, and her CT scan without abnormalities are all consistent with a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
