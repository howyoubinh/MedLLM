    "question": "A 3-month-old girl is brought to a pediatrician by her parents. She has central cyanosis without signs of respiratory distress or signs of heart failure. An echocardiogram reveals severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect, and an overriding of the aorta. An elective primary surgical repair is planned at 4 months of age. Which of the following statements is true about this girl’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The tricuspid valve is the most common valve affected by bacterial endocarditis in uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot.",
      "B": "Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.",
      "C": "Cerebral arterial thrombosis is more common than cerebral venous thrombosis.",
      "D": "Refractory heart failure is a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This girl’s condition is tetralogy of Fallot. The four components of tetralogy of Fallot are ventricular septal defect, pulmonary outflow obstruction, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The tricuspid valve is not affected in tetralogy of Fallot. Normal hemoglobin does not rule out iron deficiency anemia. Cerebral arterial thrombosis is more common than cerebral venous thrombosis in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. Refractory heart failure is not a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
