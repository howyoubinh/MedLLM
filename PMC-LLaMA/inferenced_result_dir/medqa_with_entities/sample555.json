    "question": "A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Agree to his wish for no further treatment",
      "B": "Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents",
      "C": "Reassure the patient that he will feel better",
      "D": "Start outpatient psychotherapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'A': 'Agree to his wish for no further treatment', 'B': 'Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents', 'C': 'Reassure the patient that he will feel better', 'D': 'Start outpatient psychotherapy'}[?]In this case, the patient has expressed a desire to commit suicide. The physician must first ensure the patient's safety, and involuntary hospitalization is the most appropriate course of action. The physician should inform the parents about the patient's condition and the need for hospitalization. The physician should not agree to withhold treatment, and outpatient psychotherapy alone is not appropriate.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
