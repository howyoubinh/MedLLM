    "question": "A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife for incomprehensible speech. Upon first inspection you note the man is drooling and his eyes are tearing excessively. The patient's wife explains that the man was tilling the fields on the family beet farm when she found him collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets. The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED. Vital signs are currently being obtained. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Neostigmine",
      "B": "Physostigmine",
      "C": "2-pralidoxime",
      "D": "Intubation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with organophosphate poisoning. The first step in management is removal of the patient's clothes to prevent further absorption of the organophosphate. The next step is administration of atropine followed by pralidoxime. Neostigmine and physostigmine are not indicated in the management of organophosphate poisoning. Atropine is a cholinergic antagonist that competes with acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors. Atropine is given in 0.6 mg doses intravenously every ten minutes until secretions are controlled and the patient's symptoms are improving. Pralidoxime is a cholinesterase reactivator that is used to restore neuromuscular transmission in patients with organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime is given in 1 g doses intravenously every ten minutes until the patient's symptoms are improving. The patient's clothes should be placed in a plastic bag and labeled as hazardous waste.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
