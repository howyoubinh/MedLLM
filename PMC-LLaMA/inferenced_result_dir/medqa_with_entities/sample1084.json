    "question": "Thirty minutes after delivery, a 3600-g (7-lb 15-oz) newborn has noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of her lips, and intermittent respiratory distress. She was born at 38 weeks' gestation and required bag-mask resuscitation immediately after delivery. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. Her mother has noticed the bluish lip discoloration worsen when she fed and improve when she cried. The patient's pulse is 163/min, respirations are 62/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. The crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Diffuse reticulogranular densities on chest x-ray",
      "B": "Boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray",
      "C": "Passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible",
      "D": "Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient most likely has persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation, which makes PPHN more likely than a pneumonic process. The other findings of PPHN include a heart murmur, a bounding pulse, and a hyperdynamic precordium. The chest x-ray of PPHN shows diffuse reticulogranular densities. The ECG of PPHN shows right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The echocardiogram of PPHN shows a dilated right ventricle with poor function.\n\nThe other findings of PPHN include a heart murmur, a bounding pulse, and a hyperdynamic precordium. The chest x-ray of PPHN shows diffuse reticulogranular densities. The ECG of PPHN shows right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.
