    "question": "A 28-year-old female comes to the physician’s office with a complaint of episodic chest pain. She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient’s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Raynaud's phenomenon",
      "B": "Myocardial infarction",
      "C": "Aortic dissection",
      "D": "Costochondritis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are most consistent with variant angina. This angina occurs as a result of coronary vasospasm. The episodes are usually short-lived and not associated with ST-segment elevation. The episodes can occur in clusters and are often nocturnal. The episodes of vasospasm are usually triggered by factors such as cold, emotion, or exercise. The mechanism behind this type of angina is similar to that of Raynaud’s phenomenon, which is vasospasm of the digital arteries in response to cold or emotional stress.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
