    "question": "Three days after undergoing a laparoscopic Whipple's procedure, a 43-year-old woman has swelling of her right leg. She does not have pain. She has nausea but has not vomited. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 1 month ago. She has been using an incentive spirometer every 6 hours since recovering from her surgery. Prior to admission, her only medications were a multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows mild swelling of the right thigh to the ankle; there is no erythema or pitting edema. Homan's sign is negative. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. There are five abdominal laparoscopic incisions with no erythema or discharge. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "CT pulmonary angiography",
      "B": "Compression ultrasonography",
      "C": "D-dimer level",
      "D": "2 sets of blood cultures\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The most appropriate next step in management is CT pulmonary angiography. The other tests are used to exclude DVT. The Wells' criteria are used to determine the risk of DVT and PE. This patient has one risk factor (cancer) and two clinical signs (swelling and temperature > 38°C). The most appropriate test is a CT pulmonary angiography. Compression ultrasonography is used to diagnose DVT. D-dimer level is used to exclude PE. Blood cultures are obtained to rule out bacteremia.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

There is a large variety of trocar designs available but they may be classified in two types: cutting trocars that incorporate a sharp metal or plastic rod with a cutting pyramidal or conical tip, and dilating trocars with a tip that bluntly separates and dilates tissue as force is applied; some instruments incorporate elements of both cutting and dilating trocars. The trocar is used to pierce the skin and the abdominal wall (i.e., percutaneously) and then it is usually removed, leaving the cannula or sleeve in place. Laparoscopic trocars are intended to provide access to the abdominal cavity by permitting the performance of diagnostic, therapeutic, and/or surgical procedures. Trocars are used in laparoscopic surgery to provide access for the introduction of devices such as surgical instruments and video cameras. Both reusable and single-use trocars are available."
