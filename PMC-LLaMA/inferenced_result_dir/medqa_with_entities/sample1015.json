    "question": "A 2-year-old girl is brought in to the office by her parents. They state that their daughter has recently been more irritable than usual, and she occasionally becomes pale and blue. Her parents note that she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, but it was never treated. Physical examination reveals a small child in distress. She is laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tetralogy of Fallot",
      "B": "Transposition of great vessels",
      "C": "Pulmonary hypoplasia",
      "D": "Atrial septal defect"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient most likely has tetralogy of Fallot, which is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect. It is characterized by four anatomical changes: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. The cyanosis that develops in these patients is due to a combination of decreased pulmonary blood flow and mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the left ventricle.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
