    "question": "A 19-year-old man in a 3-month relationship with a woman experiences frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers. He lives in a conservative community and does not know any openly gay men. Two days ago, he joined a local group considered by many organizations to be a hate group. Together with the other members, he attacked a gay couple on their way home from dinner. Which of the following psychological defense mechanisms is he demonstrating?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sublimation",
      "B": "Reaction formation",
      "C": "Intellectualization",
      "D": "Projection"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The man is using reaction formation as a psychological defense mechanism. He is taking on the opposite extreme behavior (violence against homosexuals) to compensate for his own homosexual impulses. His membership in the hate group and the violent attack are examples of reaction formation. Sublimation involves channeling negative impulses into socially acceptable activities, such as sports or hobbies. Intellectualization involves excessive use of intellect to avoid dealing with unpleasant emotions. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives to someone else.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
