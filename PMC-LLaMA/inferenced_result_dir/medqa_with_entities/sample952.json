    "question": "A hospitalized 34-year-old man with severe diarrhea and bloating for 1 month is diagnosed with celiac disease based on serology and duodenal biopsy. He has no history of any serious illnesses and takes no medications. He has no history of recent travel. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. At discharge from the hospital, he is given complete instructions for a strict gluten-free diet. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for the temporary control of the severe diarrhea and bloating?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Avoiding all dairy products",
      "B": "Diphenoxylate",
      "C": "Prednisone",
      "D": "Restriction of soy products"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient should be instructed to avoid all dairy products. Diphenoxylate would be contraindicated in this patient because of the known risk of addiction. Prednisone would be contraindicated because it may exacerbate the patient's diarrhea. Soy products are not contraindicated in a gluten-free diet.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
