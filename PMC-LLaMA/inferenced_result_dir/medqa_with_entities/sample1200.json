    "question": "A 28-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of fever, chills, and generalized weakness. He has no cough. He was treated for a neck abscess 6 months ago. He takes no medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years and drinks two to three beers daily. He has been using intravenous cocaine and heroin for 6 years. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are retinal hemorrhages with pale centers. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the lower left sternal border. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.3 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 14,300/mm3\nPlatelet count 278,000/mm3\nSerum\nGlucose 96 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.0 mg/dL\nTotal bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL\nAST 18 U/L\nALT 22 U/L\nTransthoracic echocardiography shows multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Two sets of blood cultures are collected. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\"",

This patient is a drug addict and injection drug use is a risk factor for infective endocarditis. The tricuspid valve is most commonly involved in drug addicts. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography for detecting vegetations. The most appropriate initial antibiotic therapy is intravenous vancomycin.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
