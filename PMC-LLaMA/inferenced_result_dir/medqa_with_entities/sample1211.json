    "question": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of vertigo and feeling unsteady while walking. She reports that she has had episodic tinnitus in her right ear for the past 3 years. Neurologic examination shows hearing loss in the right ear. An MRI of the brain is shown. Pathologic examination of this patient's lesion is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification",
      "B": "Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil",
      "C": "Hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma",
      "D": "Cells with clear cytoplasm and central round nucleus resembling a fried egg"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is A (Whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification). The MRI reveals a mass in the right cerebellopontine angle, which is most consistent with a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). The pathologic examination of a vestibular schwannoma reveals whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification. The other choices are not characteristic of vestibular schwannomas. Diagnosis: Vestibular schwannoma\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
