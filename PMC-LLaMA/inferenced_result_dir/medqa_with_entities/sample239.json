    "question": "A 48-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of progressive weakness and shortness of breath. She has had progressive shortness of breath over the last year with an intermittent non-productive cough. In addition, she complains of difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair. Her temperature is 99.6°F (37.6°C), pulse is 80/min, blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally. Diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Muscle biopsy",
      "B": "CT scan",
      "C": "Serum ANA titer",
      "D": "Skin biopsy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has dermatomyositis, which is one of the inflammatory myopathies. The typical rash described in the question stem is periorbital, but can also be found on the trunk and extremities. The rash is often photosensitive and can be pruritic. The typical age group is older adults, but it can occur in children. The other findings in the question stem are consistent with interstitial lung disease. The diagnostic test of choice is a muscle biopsy. The biopsy will show perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates with associated degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibers. The other tests listed in the question stem are not specific for dermatomyositis. A CT scan may be helpful in evaluating the extent of lung disease, but would not confirm the diagnosis. A serum ANA titer is elevated in many autoimmune diseases and would not specifically confirm the diagnosis. A skin biopsy may be helpful in evaluating the extent of the rash, but would not confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
