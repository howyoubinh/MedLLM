    "question": "A 34-year-old patient is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. An EKG shows sinus tachycardia and chest radiograph reveals an enlarged cardiac silhouette. While observing sinus tachycardia on the patient's telemetry, you note that the radial pulse cannot be palpated during inspiration. What should be the next step in management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Pericardiocentesis",
      "B": "Chest CT scan",
      "C": "Pericardial window",
      "D": "Insert chest tube"
    }

  "model_response": "Pericardiocentesis is the next step in management of this patient. The clinical picture is suggestive of cardiac tamponade. The Beck's triad of cardiac tamponade includes hypotension, soft or absent hea sounds, and jugular venous distention with a prominent x descent but an absent y descent. The most appropriate initial diagnostic test is echocardiography. However, pericardiocentesis should be performed as soon as the diagnosis is made, even before echocardiography.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
