    "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and painful swelling of her right knee for 3 weeks. She works as a professional ballet dancer and says, “I'm always trying to be in shape for my upcoming performances.” She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (99 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m2. Physical examination shows tenderness and limited range of motion in her right knee. Oral examination shows bleeding and swelling of the gums. There are diffuse petechiae around hair follicles on her abdomen and both thighs. Laboratory studies show a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, and a bleeding time of 11 minutes. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. The patient’s condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in which of the following cellular structures?",

Her symptoms are characteristic of a lysosomal storage disease, specifically the mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) known as Hurler syndrome.
