    "question": "A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of malaise. He returned from a research trip to Madagascar 2 weeks ago and has since developed a worsening fever with a maximum temperature of 102.2°F (39°C). He also reports some swelling around his neck and groin. He works as a zoologist and was in rural Madagascar studying a rare species of lemur. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and gout. He takes lisinopril and allopurinol. His temperature is 101.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On exam, he has painful erythematous cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Black hemorrhagic eschars are noted on his fingertips bilaterally. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition produces a virulence factor that has which of the following functions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cleave immunoglobulin",
      "B": "Inhibit phagocytosis",
      "C": "Inhibit ribosomal function",
      "D": "Trigger widespread inflammation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms and history suggest he has a severe form of bacterial infection, likely caused by a gram-positive bacterium. The presence of painful erythematous cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy with black hemorrhagic eschars on his fingertips bilaterally suggests a cutaneous anthrax infection. The causative organism, Bacillus anthracis, produces a virulence factor, anthrax toxin, that has four components: edema factor (EF), lethal factor (LF), protective antigen (PA), and an enzyme that cleaves immunoglobulin A (IgA). The anthrax toxin functions by binding to specific receptors on the surface of host cells. EF and LF then cleave mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling molecules, inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines and leading to widespread inflammation. The anthrax toxin does not inhibit phagocytosis, inhibit ribosomal function, or trigger widespread inflammation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
