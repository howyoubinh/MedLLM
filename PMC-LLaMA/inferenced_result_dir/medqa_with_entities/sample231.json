    "question": "A 59-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of excruciating left knee pain for 4 days. He underwent a total knee arthroplasty of his left knee joint 4 months ago. He has hypertension and osteoarthritis. Current medications include glucosamine, amlodipine, and meloxicam. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 118/71 mm Hg. Examination shows a tender, swollen left knee joint; range of motion is limited by pain. Analysis of the synovial fluid confirms septic arthritis, and the prosthesis is removed. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Staphylococcus epidermidis",
      "B": "Escherichia coli",
      "C": "Staphylococcus aureus",
      "D": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most common causal organism in septic arthritis of the knee is Staphylococcus aureus. S. epidermidis is a common cause of prosthetic joint infection, but it is less likely to cause septic arthritis in a natural joint. Escherichia coli is a common cause of septic arthritis in neonates but is less likely in adults. Pseudomonas is a common cause of septic arthritis in injection drug users.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
