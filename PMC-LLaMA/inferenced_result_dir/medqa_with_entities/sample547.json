    "question": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after his wife noticed during breakfast that the left side of his face was drooping. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and shoes before coming to the hospital. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He drinks one glass of wine daily. He is alert and oriented to time, place and person. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 99/min and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows equal and reactive pupils. There is drooping of the left side of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and lower extremities. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left side. Speech is dysarthric. There is a bruit on the right side of the neck. Fundoscopy shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum concentrations of glucose and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "MRI of the brain",
      "B": "Lumbar puncture",
      "C": "Duplex ultrasonography of the neck",
      "D": "CT scan of the head"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical diagnosis is a stroke. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a CT scan of the head. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking. This puts him at high risk for a stroke. The sudden onset of facial weakness and dysarthric speech indicates that the stroke is most likely a lacunar infarction. A CT scan of the head will confirm the diagnosis. The patient is not a candidate for thrombolysis because he has a history of hypertension. Lumbar puncture is not indicated because there are no features to suggest an infection. MRI of the brain is not the most appropriate next step because the patient needs a CT scan of the head to confirm the diagnosis. Duplex ultrasonography of the neck is not indicated because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of a stroke related to a possible carotid artery occlusion.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
