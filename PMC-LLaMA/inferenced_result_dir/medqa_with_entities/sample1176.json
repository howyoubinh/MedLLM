    "question": "A 66-year-old man comes to the physician because of fatigue and swelling of his legs and feet for 6 weeks. During this time he has felt like his eyes have been unusually puffy in the mornings and his urine has been frothy. He has hypertension and rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis. Current medications include amlodipine, methotrexate, and ibuprofen. He does not smoke. He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 148/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pallor, periorbital edema, 2+ pedal edema, and ascites. He has swan-neck deformities and nodules of multiple fingers and swelling and restricted range of motion of bilateral knee joints. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 8.2 mg/dl\nProthrombin time 12 seconds\nSerum\nAlbumin 2.8 g/dl\nTotal bilirubin 1.0 mg/dl\nAlkaline phosphatase 120 U/L\nAST 20 U/L\nALT 19 U/L\nUrea 18 mg/dl\nCreatinine 1.2 mg/dl\nUrine\nProtein 3+\nWBCs 5–10/hpf\nRBCs negative\nBacteria negative\nUltrasound of the liver and kidneys shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Adverse effect of ibuprofen",
      "B": "Decreased cardiac ejection fraction",
      "C": "Renal deposition of AL amyloid",
      "D": "Increased serum amyloid A production"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has nephrotic syndrome due to amyloidosis. Renal amyloidosis is a complication of long-standing rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's clinical picture is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, peripheral edema, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis may have contributed to his amyloidosis. The liver and kidneys are the most common sites of amyloid deposition. Amyloid is an abnormal protein that is deposited in various tissues in the body. The AA (amyloid-associated) form of amyloid is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The AL (amyloid light chain) form of amyloid is associated with plasma cell dyscrasias such as multiple myeloma. The diagnosis of amyloidosis is made by biopsy. Amyloid is seen as an amorphous, pink, hyaline material in the tissue with a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. The prognosis of amyloidosis is poor, with death occurring from complications of nephrotic syndrome or heart failure. The treatment of amyloidosis is directed at the underlying disease. Ibuprofen can cause renal and hepatic disease but not amyloid deposition. Congestive heart failure can cause pedal edema, but would not explain the other findings or the amyloid deposition. Decreased cardiac ejection fraction could cause pedal edema but would not explain the other findings or the amyloid deposition.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
