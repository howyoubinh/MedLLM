    "question": "A healthy 19-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of painless “blisters” in his mouth. He reports that he noticed a white film on his tongue and the sides of his mouth 2 days ago while brushing his teeth. The film was easily brushed off. He also complains of a bitter metallic taste in his mouth but otherwise denies pain, burning, dysphagia, or hoarseness. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. His oral examination demonstrates patches of white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Disruption of cell membrane permeability",
      "B": "Disruption of microtubule formation",
      "C": "Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase",
      "D": "Inhibition of beta-glucan synthase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s presentation is most consistent with oral thrush, or candidiasis, which is caused by Candida species. Candidiasis is an opportunistic infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients, and it is the most common fungal infection in both HIV-positive and non-HIV-positive persons. Risk factors for candidiasis include recent antibiotic or glucocorticoid use, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and immunosuppression. The pseudomembranous form of candidiasis seen in this patient is called thrush. The medication with which this patient should be treated is an azole, which works by inhibiting 14-alpha-demethylase, thereby disrupting the cell membrane permeability of the fungus. Azoles include fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole. Newer medications, such as caspofungin and micafungin, work by inhibiting beta-glucan synthase. Caspofungin is used in refractory invasive aspergillosis. Newer medications such as terbinafine work by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, which disrupts ergosterol synthesis. Griseofulvin works by inhibiting microtubule formation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
