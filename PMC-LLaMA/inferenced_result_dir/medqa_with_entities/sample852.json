    "question": "A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with nausea, vomiting, fever, and pain in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen for the past 18 hours. He mentions that he has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain at the same location over the last 3 months and that these episodes usually occur after a heavy meal and subside within 1 or 2 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. On examination of the abdomen, tenderness is present over the right upper quadrant; palpation over the area produces an inspiratory pause. An urgent bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct stone, but no stone in the common bile duct or in the gallbladder. Laboratory results show the following:\nHemoglobin 15.4 g/dL (9.56 mmol/L)\nTotal leukocyte count 14,000/mm3 (17.4 x 10*9/L)\nSegmented neutrophils 70%\nLymphocytes 25%\nMonocytes 4%\nEosinophils 1%\nBasophils 0%\nPlatelet count 32,0000/mm3 (320 x 10*9/L)\nSerum bilirubin (total) 1.8 mg/dL (30.78 μmol/L)\nSerum bilirubin (direct) 1.1 mg/dL (18.81 μmol/L)\nSerum alanine aminotransferase 96 U/L\nSerum aspartate aminotransferase 88 U/L\nSerum alkaline phosphatase\n350 U/L (5.83 μkat/L)\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
