    "question": "A 76-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Radiation therapy",
      "B": "Intravenous dexamethasone therapy",
      "C": "Intravenous acyclovir therapy",
      "D": "Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical scenario describes a patient with epidural spinal cord compression secondary to metastatic cancer. The most appropriate next step in management is to initiate high-dose corticosteroids and radiation therapy. The initial treatment of patients with spinal cord compression is to initiate corticosteroids and radiation therapy. The initial dose of corticosteroids should be equivalent to 1 mg/kg of dexamethasone. The radiation therapy is usually 3000 cGy delivered over 30 fractions. The goal of treatment is to relieve pain, restore neurologic function, and prevent further neurologic damage. If the patient does not have a known cancer, a tumor search should be undertaken. The most common tumors that cause spinal cord compression are from breast, lung, prostate, and lymphoma. Intravenous acyclovir therapy is used in patients with herpes zoster and herpes simplex infection. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy is used in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
