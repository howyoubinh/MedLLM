    "question": "Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increase in concentration of serum myoglobin",
      "B": "Closure of the ductus arteriosus",
      "C": "Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+",
      "D": "Allosteric alteration of heme groups"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This infant's initial improvement after inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP suggests that he has a reactive pulmonary artery hypertension. The blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes suggests that he has developed a severe metabolic acidosis. Increased smooth muscle cGMP relaxes the pulmonary vasculature, which decreases pulmonary artery pressure. This can lead to a steal phenomenon whereby blood flow to the pulmonary circulation decreases, leaving a larger volume of blood in the systemic circulation. If the ductus arteriosus were to close, this would only exacerbate the problem by preventing any mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The other choices are not related to the treatment of this infant's condition.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
