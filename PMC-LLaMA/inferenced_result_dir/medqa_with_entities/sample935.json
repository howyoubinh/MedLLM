Vital signs include: blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 76/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). Her physical examination is within normal limits. The woman’s complete blood count shows an absolute increase in the cells shown in the first image. Which of the following is true regarding these cells?",
    "options": {
      "A": "These cells transform to macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues.",
      "B": "These cells express CD25 on their surfaces.",
      "C": "These cells normally constitute 25–40% of total leucocyte count.",
      "D": "These cells have lymphoid origin."
