    "question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to your office with heartburn. Following an extensive workup, you diagnose her with a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. You prescribe triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of omeprazole?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Parasympathetic inhibition",
      "B": "Reversible block of H2 receptors",
      "C": "Inhibition of primary active transport",

  "model_response": "Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that irreversibly blocks H+,K+-ATPase and inhibits gastric acid secretion. Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Amoxicillin is a penicillin derivative that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
