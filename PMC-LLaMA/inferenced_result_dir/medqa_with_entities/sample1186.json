    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with pain in his left thigh for a week. He describes the pain as dull and constant, boring in nature, and localized deep below the thigh muscle. He says it is worse at night. Physical examination is significant for tenderness and warmth over the anterior aspect of the left thigh. A plain radiograph of the left femur shows increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space. Laboratory studies show:\nAlkaline phosphatase\n925 U/L\nSerum calcium\n9.2 mg/dL\nSerum phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL\nFindings on bone biopsy are shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ewing's sarcoma",
      "B": "Osteitis deformans",
      "C": "Osteochondritis dissecans",
      "D": "Osteitis fibrosa cystica"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings are consistent with osteitis fibrosa cystica, hyperparathyroidism. The bone biopsy shows osteoclasts resorbing bone (arrow). The patient had increased serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase. The increased serum calcium caused increased osteoclastic activity, which resulted in bone resorption and replacement of normal marrow with fibrous tissue, giving rise to the term osteitis fibrosa cystica. The bone resorption produced cystic lesions, typically in the long bones. The most common cause of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria is hyperparathyroidism.\n\nEwing's sarcoma (choice A) is a malignant tumor of bone. It typically occurs in children and adolescents and is characterized by pain and a mass in the bone.\n\nOsteitis deformans (choice B) is also known as Paget's disease. It is characterized by bone resorption, followed by disorganized bone remodeling. It typically occurs after age 40 and is characterized by bone pain and deformity.\n\nOsteochondritis dissecans (choice C) is characterized by a separation of a segment of articular cartilage from the underlying bone. It typically occurs in adolescents and young adults and is associated with joint pain.\n\nOsteitis fibrosa cystica (choice D) is a complication of hyperparathyroidism. It is characterized by bone resorption, cystic lesions, and replacement of normal marrow with fibrous tissue.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
