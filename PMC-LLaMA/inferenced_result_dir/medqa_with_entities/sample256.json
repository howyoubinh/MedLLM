    "question": "A 68-year-old man from California presents for a routine checkup. He does not have any complaints. He says that he has tried to keep himself healthy and active by jogging and gardening since his retirement at age 50. He adds that he spends his mornings in the park and his afternoons in his garden. He has no significant medical history. The patient denies any smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. On physical examination, the following lesion is seen on his scalp (see image). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Psoriasis",
      "B": "Seborrheic keratosis",
      "C": "Actinic keratosis",
      "D": "Squamous cell carcinoma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The lesion is an actinic keratosis. This is a rough, scaly, pink or gray plaque that develops on sun-exposed skin. It is most common on the scalp, face, neck, and hands. Actinic keratoses are considered precursors to squamous cell carcinoma. They are caused by DNA damage from UV radiation. Excessive sun exposure, fair skin, and immunosuppression are risk factors. Treatment is usually not necessary, but lesions can be removed with cryotherapy, curettage, or topical agents. Psoriasis is characterized by well-defined plaques with silvery scale. Seborrheic keratosis is a benign, pigmented, scaly lesion that is common on the face, scalp, and trunk. Bowen disease is an intraepithelial squamous cell carcinoma that presents as a slowly enlarging, erythematous, scaly plaque.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
