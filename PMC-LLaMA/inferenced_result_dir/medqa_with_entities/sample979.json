    "question": "A 67-year-old male comes into the ED complaining of dyspnea and a heavy feeling in his chest. He reports that over the past month he has become more easily “winded\" to the point that he now sleeps in his living room because he can’t make it up the stairs. A review of systems is notable for headaches and fatigue. On physical exam you note decreased breath sounds and a dullness to percussion on the right. A chest radiograph is obtained, which shows a right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis is performed and the fluid is analyzed, with results shown below:\n\nVolume: 30 cc of fluid\nPleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL\nSerum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L\n\nWhich of the following conditions may have led to the findings in this patient’s pleural cavity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Congestive heart failure",
      "B": "Liver cirrhosis",
      "C": "Lymphoma",
      "D": "Nephrotic syndrome"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s pleural fluid is consistent with a transudate. The pleural fluid/serum protein ratio is greater than 0.5, which is consistent with a transudate. The LDH level is also consistent with a transudate. Congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome can all lead to transudative pleural effusions. Lymphoma is more likely to produce a complex pleural effusion.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
