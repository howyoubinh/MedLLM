    "question": "A healthy, full-term 1-day-old female is being evaluated after birth and is noted to have a cleft palate and a systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space. A chest radiograph is obtained which reveals a boot-shaped heart and absence of a thymus. An echocardiogram is done which shows pulmonary stenosis with a hypertrophic right ventricular wall, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta. Which of the following additional features is expected to be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Seizures due to hypocalcemia",
      "B": "Catlike cry",
      "C": "Hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies",
      "D": "Increased phenylalanine in the blood"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has tetralogy of Fallot, which is a common form of congenital heart disease. The four abnormalities include ventricular septal defect, pulmonic stenosis, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. About 25% of patients with tetralogy of Fallot have a chromosomal abnormality (e.g., 22q11 deletion syndrome). This syndrome can also be associated with DiGeorge syndrome, which includes abnormal facies, thymic aplasia, and hypocalcemia due to failure of parathyroid development. Catlike cry is seen in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies is seen in neonatal Graves disease. Increased phenylalanine in the blood is seen in phenylketonuria.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
