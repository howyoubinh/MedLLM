    "question": "A 21-year-old female presents to the office after a health screening in which she was found to have high blood pressure. At the office, the blood pressure is 168/114 mm Hg. You have seen the patient in the past for amenorrhea and infertility issues, but she denies taking any medication at this time. On examination, the patient is short and normal weight but has a webbed neck. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys ",
      "B": "Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension",
      "C": "Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland",
      "D": "Oral contraceptive use"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has features of Conn syndrome, which is a genetic predisposition to essential hypertension. The physical examination findings of a webbed neck and abnormal weight gain are consistent with hyperaldosteronism. The most common cause of Conn syndrome is a neoplasm of the adrenal gland, which can be either benign or malignant. The other choices are not consistent with the clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
