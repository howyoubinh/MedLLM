    "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the office complaining of pelvic pain and feeling “off” for the past few weeks. She has not had any changes in diet or lifestyle but reports weight loss despite an increase in appetite. In addition, she has been experiencing chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Physical exam of her thyroid is unremarkable but her TSH was found to be 0.21 mIU/L. A complex structure in her right ovary was detected on ultrasound. Her symptoms can be explained by which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Meigs syndrome",
      "B": "Jod-Basedow phenomenon",
      "C": "Dermoid cyst",
      "D": "Struma ovarii"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The symptoms of this patient are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The presence of a complex cyst in the ovary raises the concern of a malignant process such as a dermoid cyst or struma ovarii. The incidence of Meigs syndrome (benign ovarian neoplasm with associated pleural effusion and ascites) is quite low, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this syndrome. Jod-Basedow phenomenon refers to the development of Graves disease in patients with multinodular goiter after iodine exposure. This patient's thyroid findings are not consistent with this phenomenon.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
