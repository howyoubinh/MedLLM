    "question": "A previously healthy 24-year-old man comes to the physician 1 day after the onset of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger. He works as a dental assistant and is concerned about not being able to work. The patient wonders if the symptoms might be related to a hunting trip he returned from 1 week ago because he remembers seeing a lot of poison oak. He is sexually active with one female partner, and they do not use condoms. His father has a history of thromboangiitis obliterans. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years. He drinks two to four beers on social occasions. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows swelling and erythema of the pulp space of the left index finger; there are multiple 3-mm vesicles. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,000 cells/mm3. In addition to supportive therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Oral acyclovir",
      "B": "Oral cephalexin",
      "C": "Smoking cessation",
      "D": "Washing thoroughly\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's history of a pack-a-day smoking habit and the clinical picture of a painful, swollen finger with blisters are consistent with a diagnosis of herpetic whitlow. This is a cutaneous infection of the fingertip pulp caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. The infection may be primary or recurrent. The patient should be advised to wash his hands frequently and to avoid contact with the vesicular fluid. Oral acyclovir is the treatment of choice. Cephalexin is an antibiotic that would be used if the finger were secondarily infected. Smoking cessation is important because smoking increases the risk for secondary infections and reduces the effectiveness of acyclovir.\n\nHerpetic whitlow is most commonly seen in dental workers, medical workers, and food handlers. The infection is caused by direct contact with the virus. The virus is inoculated into the skin through even minor cuts and abrasions. The incubation period is 2 days to 2 weeks. The initial lesions are vesicles that may coalesce and ulcerate. The pain and swelling are usually severe. The diagnosis is clinical, although the Tzanck test (a rapid, in-office diagnostic test) may be helpful. Treatment is symptomatic, with analgesics and acyclovir.\n\nHerpes simplex virus type 2 infection of the fingers is called herpetic Whitlow. Herpetic Whitlow is most commonly seen in dental workers, medical workers, and food handlers.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
