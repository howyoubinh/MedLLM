    "question": "A 27-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents for a 3-month follow-up after starting treatment with lithium. She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Lamotrigine",
      "B": "Valproate",
      "C": "Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)",
      "D": "Paroxetine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient was prescribed lamotrigine. The targetoid rash is characteristic of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS is a severe cutaneous adverse reaction that is most commonly drug-induced. The most common drugs that cause SJS are antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), particularly carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lamotrigine. The rash usually develops within 2 months of therapy, but it can occur as early as 1 week after therapy is started. The rash is usually initially described as a maculopapular rash that can progress to involve vesicles and bullae. The rash is usually initially localized on the face and torso, but it can become more widespread. The rash is usually accompanied by fever, constitutional symptoms, and subsequent desquamation. The OFC is also associated with rash, but it is usually urticarial rather than targetoid. Paroxetine is also associated with rash, but it is usually described as an urticarial rash rather than a targetoid rash. Valproate is not typically associated with rash.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
