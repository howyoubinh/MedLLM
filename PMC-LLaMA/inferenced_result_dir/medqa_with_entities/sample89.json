    "question": "A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Methimazole",
      "B": "Propylthiouracil",
      "C": "Radioiodine therapy",
      "D": "Thyroidectomy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with hyperthyroidism. The elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level and inappropriately elevated FT4 level confirm the diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms, along with her physical exam findings, indicate that she has a hyperfunctioning thyroid gland, most likely Graves’ disease. The treatment of choice for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is a thionamide. Both propylthiouracil and methimazole cross the placenta and can be used. However, propylthiouracil is the preferred agent because its greater protein binding allows less transfer to the fetus. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated during pregnancy because it can destroy the fetal thyroid tissue. Surgery is rarely indicated during pregnancy, and usually only for patients with large goiters who have had thyroid cancer.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
