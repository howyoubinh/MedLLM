    "question": "A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?",
    "options": {
      "A": "An increase in right atrial pressure",
      "B": "An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure",
      "C": "A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential",
      "D": "A reduction in diastolic filling time"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The answer is C: A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential. When a person stands up from a supine position, blood pools in the lower extremities. This causes a decrease in venous return to the heart, which results in a decrease in end-diastolic volume. The decrease in end-diastolic volume decreases the slope of the pacemaker potential.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
