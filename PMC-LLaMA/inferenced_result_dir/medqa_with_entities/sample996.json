  "model_response": "The heavy chain determines the class of immunoglobulin. There are five known classes of immunoglobulin heavy chain: gamma (y), alpha (a), delta (8), mu (u), and epsilon (e). The most common heavy chains are y (gamma) and a (alpha). The e chain is found only in the IgE molecule. IgG, IgA, and IgM all have y chains. IgA and IgG have an extra constant domain in their heavy chains. This is the secretory component in IgA and the Fc fragment in IgG and IgM. The Fc fragment is composed of the carboxyterminal portion of the heavy chain and is not antigen-specific. It is this fragment that determines the biological activity of the immunoglobulin molecule. IgG is the predominant antibody in the secondary immune response and is the only immunoglobulin found as a dimer. IgM is the predominant antibody in the primary immune response. IgM can be present as a pentamer in the circulation. IgE is the primary antibody in type I hypersensitivity reactions. It is also the antibody that binds to the surface of cells for the placental transfer of IgG to the fetus. IgD is found on the surface of many B cells and may be an antigen receptor. It is also found in the serum as a monomer. IgE and IgD have y heavy chains. IgD is found in very small amounts in the serum.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

They are comprised of two heavy (IMMUNOGLOBULIN HEAVY CHAINS) and two light chains (IMMUNOGLOBULIN LIGHT CHAINS) with additional ancillary polypeptide chains depending on their isoforms. The variety of isoforms include monomeric or polymeric forms, and transmembrane forms (B-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTORS) or secreted forms (ANTIBODIES). They are divided by the amino acid sequence of their heavy chains into five classes (IMMUNOGLOBULIN A; IMMUNOGLOBULIN D; IMMUNOGLOBULIN E; IMMUNOGLOBULIN G; IMMUNOGLOBULIN M) and various subclasses."
