After a physical exam and a series of laboratory tests, the patient undergoes a lymph node biopsy (Image A). Three days later, while awaiting treatment, he presents to his physician complaining of generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on renal biopsy in this patient?",
