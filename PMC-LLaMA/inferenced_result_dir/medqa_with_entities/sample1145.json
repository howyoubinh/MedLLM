    "question": "A 33-year-old woman at 17-weeks gestation comes to the physician for evaluation of a painless mass in the right breast for the last 3 weeks that has not increased in size. Physical examination shows dense breasts and a 2.5-cm rubbery, mobile mass that is nontender in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. A biopsy of the mass shows rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Fibroadenoma",
      "B": "Normal pregnancy-related changes",
      "C": "Fat necrosis",
      "D": "Phyllodes tumor"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is a fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are the most common benign tumor of the female breast. They are frequently multiple and can enlarge during pregnancy and lactation due to increased estrogen levels. Fibroadenomas are composed of stromal and epithelial elements. The epithelial element is typically more cellular than the surrounding breast tissue, but it is not considered to be a precancerous condition. Fat necrosis is a complication of breast biopsy and presents as a palpable mass that is usually associated with skin thickening and retraction of the nipple. Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial tumors that are usually benign but can be malignant. They are typically larger than fibroadenomas and have a bulbous protrusion on gross examination. Normal pregnancy-related changes are typically bilateral and present as enlarged, tender breasts with prominent veins. Breast cancer is uncommon during pregnancy, but it can occur and is typically of a special type called inflammatory breast cancer.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
