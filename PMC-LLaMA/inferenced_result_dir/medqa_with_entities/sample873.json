    "question": "A 2-hour-old, 3.2 kg (7.0 lb) newborn boy born by cesarean delivery is being evaluated by the resident on-call. The child was born to a gravida 2, para 0 mother with known hepatitis B. The mother made it to all of her prenatal appointments and took the recommended dose of folic acid since conception. She gave up smoking when she discovered she was pregnant. The infant’s heart rate is 150/min, respiratory rate is 48/min, temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), and blood pressure is 80/52 mm Hg. APGAR testing exhibits a score of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The head is normocephalic. No neural tube defects are present on inspection or palpation of the spine. There is strong flexion in all 4 extremities. Cranial nerves 2–12 are intact. Sensory and deep tendon reflexes are without any abnormalities. Which of the following is the best course of action for the newborn child?\nHepatitis B serology\nHBsAg positive\nHBeAg positive\nIgM HBc negative\nTotal anti-HBc positive\nAnti-HBs negative\nAnti-HBc negative\nHBV DNA greater than 1 million IU/mL\nAlanine transferase normal",

      "A": "Administer hepatitis B vaccine",
      "B": "Administer hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG)",
      "C": "Administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG",
      "D": "Check hepatitis B serology"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The child should receive both the hepatitis B vaccine and the hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). The mother was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hence the child is at risk for this disease. The mother was not positive for hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg), so the child likely does not have an active infection. The child should receive the hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG to prevent infection from the virus.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
