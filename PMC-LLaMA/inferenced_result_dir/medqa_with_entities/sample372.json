    "question": "A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion. His symptoms started a few days ago and have been gradually worsening. Initially, the patient had a fever and a cough which has progressed to abdominal pain, diarrhea, and confusion. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for localized crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field. The patient is confused and is answering questions inappropriately. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 12 g/dL\nHematocrit: 36%\nLeukocyte count: 16,500/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 190,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 130 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the best diagnostic test to guide current therapy in this patient?",

The chest radiograph is the best diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the extent of the abscess. Sputum culture will be negative as the abscess is usually due to mixed anaerobic infection. The urine antigen test is used for diagnosing Legionella infection which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
