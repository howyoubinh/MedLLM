    "question": "A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bone marrow-derived macrophages",
      "B": "CD4+ T lymphocytes",
      "C": "Natural killer cells",
      "D": "Band neutrophils"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by natural killer (NK) cells, which are part of the innate immune system. NK cells are defined by the expression of CD56 and the lack of CD3. They have the ability to recognize and kill stressed and abnormal cells, such as virus-infected cells and tumor cells, without the need for prior activation. NK cells are not antigen-specific, unlike cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are part of the adaptive immune system. CTLs recognize antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and are activated by antigen-presenting cells. Band neutrophils are immature neutrophils. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system. CD4+ T lymphocytes are a type of helper T cell.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
