    "question": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. She has no similar symptoms and is in good health. Her parents are healthy. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother?",
    "options": {
      "A": "67%",
      "B": "100%",
      "C": "75%",
      "D": "50%"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The woman's carrier status can be assessed by determining the frequency of the recessive allele for the disease. The frequency of the recessive allele can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which states that the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is equal to the frequency of the disease (p) divided by the frequency of the normal allele (2p) plus the frequency of the disease allele (q). In this case, the frequency of the recessive allele is (0.01) / (0.99 + 0.01) = 0.01/1.99 = 0.01 or 1%. This means that there is a 1% chance that her children will be affected, a 1% chance that they will be unaffected carriers, and a 89% chance that they will be unaffected and not carriers.\n\n###OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
