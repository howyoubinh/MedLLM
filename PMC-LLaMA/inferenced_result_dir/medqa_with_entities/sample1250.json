    "question": "A 37-year-old woman with an HIV infection comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Six months ago, combined antiretroviral therapy consisting of dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine was initiated. Laboratory studies show a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen, including a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. Which of the following is the most likely drug?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Efavirenz",
      "B": "Ritonavir",
      "C": "Raltegravir",

Ritonavir is a pharmacokinetic booster used in combination with other protease inhibitors. Lamivudine is an NRTI. Tenofovir is an NRTI. Emtricitabine is an NRTI.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
