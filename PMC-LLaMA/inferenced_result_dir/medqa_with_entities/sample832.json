    "question": "Two hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 40 weeks’ gestation is evaluated for the sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension. The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Apical ballooning of the left ventricle",
      "B": "Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins",
      "C": "Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space",
      "D": "Systemic bacterial infection"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has suffered a rare but catastrophic complication of labor, amniotic fluid embolism. This condition is characterized by the entry of fetal tissues, cells, and fluids into the maternal circulation. Amniotic fluid enters the uterine veins via the placental site, bypassing the lungs. The fetal cells trigger a profound maternal inflammatory response, with release of thromboplastin and consumption of procoagulants, particularly fibrinogen. The end result is disseminated intravascular coagulation. The initial presentation is usually sudden onset of respiratory distress, hypotension, and cyanosis during labor or within 2 hours after delivery. The classic triad of symptoms is hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy. The diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is supportive, with attention to oxygenation, blood pressure, and coagulopathy. The mortality rate is 80%.\n\nAmniotic fluid embolism should be distinguished from pulmonary embolism of amniotic fluid. In this condition, the patient develops profound respiratory distress during labor or in the immediate postpartum period. The diagnosis is usually made with echocardiography, which shows an abrupt decrease in right ventricular return and ejection. This condition is uniformly fatal.\n\nApical ballooning of the left ventricle is a feature of peripartum cardiomyopathy, which is a dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of delivery. Patients present with congestive heart failure. Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space is a rare but potentially fatal complication of spinal or epidural anesthesia. It usually occurs with accidental intrathecal injection of a large volume of anesthetic agent. The classic presentation is a high spinal block, with hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory insufficiency. Systemic bacterial infection is a common cause of spontaneous abortion in the first trimester. It usually presents with fever, chills, and malodorous vaginal discharge.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
