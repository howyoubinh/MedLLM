    "question": "A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician with her father for evaluation of her short stature. She feels well overall, but is concerned because all of her friends are taller than her. Her birth weight was normal. Her father reports he had a short stature during his teenage years; he is currently 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Pelvic ultrasound",
      "B": "Measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels",
      "C": "Reassurance and follow-up",
      "D": "MRI of the brain"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The girl in the question has short stature, which is common in adolescents. Short stature in adolescents can be due to chronic disease, malnutrition, endocrine disorders, skeletal disorders, and normal variants. The normal variant is familial genetic short stature, which is most common. Familial short stature is a common cause of short stature in adolescents. It is most common in boys, and is thought to be due to decreased growth hormone secretion. In most cases, short stature is a result of normal variation; these children usually have a delay in bone maturation. In contrast, endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency are usually associated with poor growth and weight gain, and the bone age is less than chronological age. In this case, the bone age is normal for chronological age. The girl in the question has no signs or symptoms of chronic disease. She has normal sexual development, which is consistent with a normal variant cause of short stature. Reassurance and follow-up is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
