    "question": "A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of her right hand. Specifically, she says that she was gardening 8 hours prior to presentation when she sustained a laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Since then, they have become red and swollen. She has also had pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years and reports that this pain is worse in the morning but improves over the day. The cells that are present in this patient's DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?",

      "A": "DIP has fewer neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP",
      "B": "DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP",
