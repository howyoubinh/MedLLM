    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a general checkup. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation and is currently taking warfarin, insulin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. The patient’s brother recently died from a heart attack and he has switched to an all vegetarian diet in order to improve his health. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient’s physical exam is unremarkable. His laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 12 g/dL\nHematocrit: 36%\nLeukocyte count: 7,550/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 197,000/mm^3\nINR: 1.0\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the best explanation for this patient’s laboratory values?",
