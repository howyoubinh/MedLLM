    "question": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Sarcoidosis",
      "B": "Pulmonary tuberculosis",
      "C": "Hodgkin's lymphoma",
      "D": "Histoplasmosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The x-ray shows bilateral hilar adenopathy with a \"salt and pepper\" appearance. The cardiac border is clear. There is no parenchymal infiltrate. The clinical findings, including the low oxygen saturation, are consistent with a pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome. The differential diagnosis includes granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, as well as malignancy and histoplasmosis. The presence of ankle pain and the \"salt and pepper\" appearance of the hila suggest the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
