    "question": "A 44-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue, intermittent fever, a 4.0-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss, and a progressive, non-productive cough. She does not smoke. Physical examination shows mild wheezing over bilateral lung fields and enlarged supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes. A CT scan of the chest is shown. A biopsy specimen of a cervical lymph node shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis. The initial treatment of this patient's condition should include which of the following drugs?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cisplatin",
      "B": "Lamivudine",
      "C": "Isoniazid",
      "D": "Prednisone"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The CT scan shows a typical appearance of sarcoidosis, with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular densities in a perihilar distribution. The noncaseating granulomas seen on biopsy are diagnostic. The initial treatment of sarcoidosis is with glucocorticoids.\n\nThe other choices are not typically used in the treatment of sarcoidosis. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy agent used in the treatment of many solid tumors. Lamivudine is an antiviral used in the treatment of HIV. Isoniazid is an antimycobacterial used in the treatment of tuberculosis. Prednisone is a corticosteroid used in the treatment of sarcoidosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
