    "question": "A 5-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of poor feeding, irritability, and noisy breathing. The mother did not receive any prenatal care. His respirations are 26/min. Physical examination shows sunken fontanelles, tightly clenched fists, and erythema around the umbilical cord stump. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of the disease process in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels",
      "B": "Destruction of Schwann cells",
      "C": "Decreased release of glycine",
      "D": "Destruction of anterior horn cells"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings described are those of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), which is most commonly seen in children born of diabetic mothers. NRDS is caused by a deficiency of surfactant, a lipoprotein substance that reduces alveolar surface tension and therefore facilitates gas exchange. Surfactant is produced by type II pneumocytes. Its production is dependent on the presence of oxygen and glucocorticoids. In diabetic mothers, fetal oxygenation is impaired, and glucocorticoid levels are not appropriately elevated. The other choices are not related to the pathogenesis of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.Diagnosis: Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
