    "question": "A 46-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his eyes, generalized fatigue, and pruritus. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 7 years ago. At the time of diagnosis, a pANCA test was also positive. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and multiple scratch marks on the trunk and extremities. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Serum studies show a total bilirubin concentration of 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin concentration of 2.5 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase level of 450 U/L. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography shows focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation. Histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis",
      "B": "Periportal lymphocytic infiltration and piecemeal necrosis",
      "C": "Irregular ductal glands lined by atypical and pleomorphic cells",
      "D": "Ductopenia and fibrotic degeneration of periportal hepatocytes"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical and histologic findings are consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a chronic cholestatic disease that is characterized by diffuse inflammation and fibrosis involving the entire biliary tree, leading to chronic cholestasis. PSC is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis. The disease most commonly presents in the fourth through fifth decades of life. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating characteristic changes in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Histologic changes include a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the portal tracts, periportal piecemeal necrosis, and fibrotic obliteration of bile ducts. The lumen of the bile ducts may be completely obliterated, leaving just a solid cord scar with few inflammatory cells. The other choices are not characteristic of PSC.Diagnosis: Primary sclerosing cholangitis\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
