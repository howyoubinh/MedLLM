Examination shows the right upper extremity is externally rotated and slightly abducted. There is loss of the the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder. The right humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process. Sensation to pinprick over which of the following skin areas is most likely to be reduced?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Medial aspect of the upper arm",
      "B": "Lateral aspect of the shoulder",
      "C": "Skin above the clavicle",
      "D": "Dorsal aspect of forearm and hand"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The sensory nerve supply to the skin areas in question is as follows: The medial aspect of the upper arm is supplied by the medial brachial cutaneous nerve, a branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus. The lateral aspect of the shoulder is supplied by the upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm, a branch of the axillary nerve. The skin above the clavicle is supplied by the supraclavicular nerves, branches of C3 and C4. The dorsal aspect of the forearm and hand is supplied by the superficial branch of the radial nerve.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
