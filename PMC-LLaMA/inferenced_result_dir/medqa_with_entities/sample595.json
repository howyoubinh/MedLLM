    "question": "A 19-year-old female college soccer player presents to a sports medicine clinic with right knee pain. One day prior she twisted her right knee and felt a “pop” while chasing after a ball. She has since felt severe throbbing knee pain and noticed a rapid increase in swelling around her knee. She is able to bear weight but feels “unstable” on her right leg. On exam, anterior drawer and Lachman’s tests are positive. The physician informs her that she has likely injured an important structure in her knee. What is the function of the structure that she has most likely injured?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Prevent excess posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur",
      "B": "Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur",
      "C": "Resist excess valgus force on the knee",
      "D": "Provide a cushion between the lateral tibial and femoral condyles"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The structure that has most likely been injured is the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL prevents excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. The structure that resists excess valgus force on the knee is the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). The structure that prevents excess posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur is the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The structure that provides a cushion between the lateral tibial and femoral condyles is the lateral meniscus.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
