    "question": "A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his primary care physician for pain in his right shoulder. The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Supraspinatus",
      "B": "Infraspinatus",
      "C": "Teres minor",
      "D": "Deltoid"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The above scenario describes a patient with an injury to the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder. The supraspinatus muscle is most commonly injured during overhead activities or weight lifting. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for the first 15 degrees of abduction of the shoulder. The supraspinatus muscle is innervated by the suprascapular nerve. The suprascapular nerve is a branch of the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. The infraspinatus muscle is responsible for external rotation and is innervated by the suprascapular nerve. The teres minor muscle is also responsible for external rotation and is innervated by the axillary nerve. The deltoid muscle is responsible for abduction and is innervated by the axillary nerve. The biceps brachii muscle is responsible for flexion and supination of the forearm and is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
