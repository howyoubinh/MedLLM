    "question": "An unidentified surgical specimen is received for histopathologic analysis. A portion of the specimen is cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The remainder is analyzed and is found to contains type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Which of the following structures is most likely the origin of this surgical specimen?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blood vessel",
      "B": "Pinna",
      "C": "Lens",

  "model_response": "The answer is D. The larynx is composed of numerous small cartilaginous structures, including the vocal cords, that are composed of type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate. The epiglottis is a large cartilage that is elastic in nature and lacks type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate. The blood vessels, pinna, and lens are composed of fibrillar collagen, not cartilage.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
