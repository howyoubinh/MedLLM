    "question": "A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He has returned to work as a cruise ship attendant. Preoperative workup included chest radiography which demonstrated an opacification in his right middle lobe. The patient agrees to undergo computed tomography (CT) of his chest without contrast for further evaluation. The radiologist reports an 8 mm nodule in the patient's peripheral right middle lobe that has regular margins and appears calcified. One year later, the patient obtains another chest CT without contrast that reports the nodule size as 10 mm with similar characteristics. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "CT chest without contrast in 24 months",
      "B": "Positive emission tomography (PET) of chest now",
      "C": "Right middle lobectomy now",
      "D": "Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy now"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's nodule has grown from 8 mm to 10 mm over the course of one year. The nodule is calcified, which makes malignancy less likely. However, the nodule is 10 mm, which necessitates a more aggressive approach. A CT scan of the chest with intravenous contrast is warranted to better delineate the nodule and its anatomic relationships. If the nodule is still 10 mm or larger, a biopsy should be performed. If the nodule is less than 10 mm, a follow-up scan in 24 months is acceptable. A PET scan is not indicated because it would not add any useful information to the management of this patient. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not concerning enough to warrant bronchoscopy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
