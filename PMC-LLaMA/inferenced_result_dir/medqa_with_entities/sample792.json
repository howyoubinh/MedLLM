    "question": "A 46-year-old woman presents with difficulty initiating sleep, as well as frequent nighttime awakenings. She reports making multiple mistakes at her office job, has an inability to concentrate, and feels sleepy throughout the day. She is worried that her sleeping troubles will cause her to get fired. Which of the following would best treat this patient’s insomnia pharmacologically?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chlordiazepoxide",
      "B": "Triazolam",
      "C": "Diazepam",
      "D": "Modafinil"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are suggestive of primary insomnia, which is a diagnosis of exclusion. The patient’s insomnia is chronic, and she has daytime symptoms of fatigue and impaired function. Benzodiazepines are effective for the treatment of short-term insomnia, but long-term use can lead to dependence. Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as zolpidem and zaleplon, have a lower potential for dependence. Modafinil is used to treat narcolepsy and may not be effective for insomnia related to poor sleep hygiene. Chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and triazolam are all benzodiazepines and should be avoided due to the risk of dependence.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
