    "question": "A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism",
      "B": "Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)",
      "C": "Past medical history of breast cancer",
      "D": "Known liver neoplasm"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is associated with a slightly increased risk of thromboembolic events, and therefore should not be used in women with a history of stroke or venous thromboembolism. The presence of breast cancer is not a contraindication to IUD use, nor is a history of PID. However, women with Wilson's disease are not good candidates for copper IUDs because of the potential for copper deposition in the liver.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
