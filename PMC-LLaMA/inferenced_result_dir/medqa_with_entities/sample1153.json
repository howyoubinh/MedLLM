    "question": "A 68-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of increased fatigue and back pain for the past year. His symptoms are progressively getting worse over the past few months despite adequate rest and trial of over the counter analgesics. His back pain is constant and non-radiating in nature. He denies any trauma to his back. His past medical history is insignificant. On examination, there is mild tenderness over the lumbar region in the midline with an absence of paraspinal muscle tenderness. Straight leg raise test is negative. His skin and conjunctiva appear pale. The physician orders basic blood work. His results are provided below.\nComplete blood count\nRBC 4.9 million cells/µL\nHemoglobin 9.8 g/dL\nHematocrit 41%\nTotal leukocyte count 6,800 cells/µL\nNeutrophils 70%\nLymphocyte 26%\nMonocytes 3%\nEosinophil 1%\nBasophils 0%\nPlatelets 230,000 cells/µL\nBasic Metabolic Panel\nSodium 136 mEq/L\nPotassium 5.1 mEq/L\nChloride 101 mEq/L\nBicarbonate 24 mEq/L\nAlbumin 3.6 mg/ dL\nUrea nitrogen 31 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2.7 mg/dL\nUric Acid 6.7 mg/dL\nCalcium 12.1 mg/dL\nGlucose 105 mg/dL\nUrinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?",

      "A": "Overflow proteinuria",
      "B": "Transient (functional) proteinuria",
      "C": "Orthostatic proteinuria",
      "D": "Isolated proteinuria"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s proteinuria best fits in the category of isolated proteinuria. Isolated proteinuria is proteinuria without accompanying RBCs or pus cells. It is seen in the setting of multiple myeloma and other paraproteinemic states. Overflow proteinuria is proteinuria due to increased glomerular permeability to high molecular weight proteins. It is seen in the setting of multiple myeloma and amyloidosis. Transient (functional) proteinuria is proteinuria due to excessive glomerular filtration. It is seen in the setting of fever, congestive heart failure, and exercise. Orthostatic proteinuria is proteinuria due to decreased renal plasma flow in the upright position. It is seen in the setting of hypoalbuminemia.\n\nGiven the patient’s laboratory findings, he has a normocytic, normochromic anemia. The differential includes anemia of chronic disease. Chronic diseases associated with anemia of chronic disease include cancer, inflammatory diseases, and renal diseases. The patient’s anemia is likely due to his chronic back pain and fatigue. His fatigue is likely due to his anemia. His back pain is likely due to osteoporosis secondary to his chronic renal disease. His laboratory findings show a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased serum creatinine. His decreased GFR and increased serum creatinine are due to his chronic kidney disease. His chronic kidney disease is likely secondary to his longstanding hypertension. His laboratory findings show a metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate) and hyperkalemia. His metabolic acidosis is likely due to his chronic kidney disease. His hyperkalemia is likely due to his chronic kidney disease and his use of amlodipine. His laboratory findings show hypocalcemia. His hypocalcemia is likely due to his chronic kidney disease. His chronic kidney disease leads to decreased activation of vitamin D, which leads to decreased intestinal absorption of calcium. His laboratory findings show anemia. His anemia is likely due to his chronic kidney disease. His chronic kidney disease leads to decreased erythropoietin production, which leads to decreased red blood cell production. His laboratory findings show anemia. His anemia is likely due to his chronic kidney disease. His chronic kidney disease leads to decreased erythropoietin production, which leads to decreased red blood cell production.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory findings show anemia.
