    "question": "A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?",
    "options": {
      "A": "64",
      "B": "16",
      "C": "8",
      "D": "4"
    }
  },
  "model_response": ":\nThe relationship between pressure and flow in a vessel is given by Poiseuille's law:\n\nwhere P is the pressure difference across the vessel, r is the radius, L is the length, and n is the viscosity.\n\nBecause the vessel diameter has decreased by 50%, the resistance to flow (R) has increased by the factor 4/50 or 16.\n\nNote that the resistance to flow in a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. Therefore, even a small decrease in the diameter of a vessel can have a large effect on resistance.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
