    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to a left breast lump under his nipple. He noticed it last month and felt that it has increased slightly in size. It is tender to touch but has no overlying skin changes. There is no breast discharge. The patient has cryptorchidism as an infant and underwent a successful orchiopexy. In addition, he was recently diagnosed with ADHD and is currently on methylphenidate with improvement in his symptoms. He has a family history of type I diabetes in his father and breast fibroadenoma in his mother. On exam, the patient is at the 82nd percentile for height, 79th percentile for weight, and 80th percentile for BMI. He has tanner IV pubic hair. Testicular volume is 7 mL on each side, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile. Breast exam shows a normal right breast and a 3-centimeter round, firm, and slightly tender discrete mass under the left nipple. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Klinefelter syndrome",
      "B": "Glandular tissue enlargement",
      "C": "Lipomastia (pseudogynecomastia)",
      "D": "Testicular cancer"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely etiology of this patient’s condition is glandular tissue enlargement. The presence of gynecomastia in a male with a history of cryptorchidism should raise suspicion for Klinefelter syndrome. However, the patient’s testicular volume is normal, which makes Klinefelter syndrome less likely. Lipomastia (pseudogynecomastia) is a form of localized fat deposition and would not present with a tender mass. Testicular cancer is unlikely because the patient has no testicular pain, mass, or atrophy. The patient’s BMI is normal, which makes obesity less likely.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
