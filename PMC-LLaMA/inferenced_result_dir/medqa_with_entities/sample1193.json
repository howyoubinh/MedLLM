He was taking triple antiretroviral therapy but stopped a few months ago because he was feeling well. He lives in Wyoming. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 47/mm3 (N â‰¥ 500). The patient currently refuses to restart antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following medication regimens is most appropriate at this time?",
