    "question": "A 65-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for stiffness in his arm. He states that he has been having trouble combing his hair and reaching objects that are high on the shelf. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and hypertension. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient admits to leading a sedentary life in which he tends to stay home and watch television. He does not engage in any physical or strenuous activity. On physical exam the patient has decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder. Strength of the patient's upper extremity is 4/5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Rotator cuff impingement",
      "B": "Adhesive capsulitis",
      "C": "Glenohumeral osteoarthritis",
      "D": "Subacromial bursitis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The most likely diagnosis is adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder. This condition is characterized by progressive pain and stiffness of the shoulder, which usually resolve spontaneously after about 18 months. The etiology is unknown, but it is more common in patients with a history of diabetes, Dupuytren's contracture, hyperlipidemia, and hemiplegia. Physical findings include restricted range of motion, painful restriction of motion, and normal strength. Rotator cuff impingement is characterized by pain with active range of motion and normal strength. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis is characterized by pain with active range of motion and decreased strength. Subacromial bursitis is characterized by pain with active range of motion and normal strength.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
