    "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Antisocial personality disorder",
      "B": "Borderline personality disorder",
      "C": "Normal grief response",
      "D": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's behavior following the diagnosis of a spontaneous abortion is consistent with a normal grief response. The grief response can include anger and aggression. The patient's behavior prior to the diagnosis of a spontaneous abortion is consistent with a honeymoon phase of a borderline personality disorder. The honeymoon phase is characterized by the patient's idealization of the physician and the medical staff. The patient's behavior following the diagnosis of a spontaneous abortion is consistent with a reactive depression seen in post-traumatic stress disorder. The patient's behavior prior to the diagnosis of a spontaneous abortion is not consistent with a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. The patient's behavior prior to the diagnosis of a spontaneous abortion is not consistent with a diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
