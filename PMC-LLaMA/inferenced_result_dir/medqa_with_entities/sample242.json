    "question": "A 5-year-old female presents to the pediatrician for a routine office visit. The patient is in kindergarten and doing well in school. She is learning to read and is able to write her first name. Her teacher has no concerns. The patient’s mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and often returns home from school with most of her packed lunch uneaten. The patient’s past medical history is significant for moderate persistent asthma, which has required three separate week-long courses of prednisone over the last year and recently diagnosed myopia. The patient’s mother is 5’7”, and the patient’s father is 5’10”. The patient’s weight and height are in the 55th and 5th percentile, respectively, which is consistent with her growth curve. On physical exam, the patient has a low hairline and a broad chest. Her lungs are clear with a mild expiratory wheeze. The patient’s abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. She has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair.\n\nThis patient is most likely to have which of the following additional findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear",
      "B": "Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level",
      "C": "Elevated serum TSH level",
      "D": "Mass in the sella turcica"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is the most common karyotypic abnormality causing gonadal failure and primary hypogonadism in females. It is characterized by primary hypogonadism, short stature, webbed neck, low hairline, shield-shaped chest, wide chest, short fourth metacarpal, and cubitus valgus. Cardiac (30% have coarctation of the aorta) and renal (especially horseshoe kidney) abnormalities are also associated with Turner syndrome. Short stature is often associated with other skeletal abnormalities, including short fourth metacarpal and cubitus valgus. Barr bodies are normally present in the cytoplasm of normal female somatic cells, and their absence suggests an abnormal karyotype. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level is associated with rickets, hepatobiliary disease, and pregnancy. An elevated serum TSH level is associated with primary hypothyroidism. A mass in the sella turcica is associated with pituitary adenoma.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
