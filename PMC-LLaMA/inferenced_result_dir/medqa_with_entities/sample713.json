    "question": "A 16-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room with acute vomiting and abdominal pain that began earlier today. His parents say that the boy was doing well until two days ago when he told them that he was feeling unwell. He has diabetes and takes insulin but stopped taking it when he began to feel poorly two days ago. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are shallow and rapid with a rate of 33/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 101/68 mm Hg. He appears severely dehydrated, showing signs of fatigue, and poor skin turgor. His breath has a fruity smell to it. His blood glucose level is 691 mg/dL. Blood is drawn for labs and the results are given below:\nSerum:  \n  pH: 7.21\n  pCO2: 32 mm HG\n  HCO 3-: 15.2 mEq/L\nSodium: 122 mEq/L\nPotassium: 5.8 mEq/L\nUrinalysis is positive for ketone bodies. What is the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Administer IV fluids and insulin",
      "B": "Administer IV antibiotics",
      "C": "Administer IV fluids with oral antidiabetic medications",
      "D": "Administer potassium and magnesium"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient is to administer IV fluids and insulin. The patient is suffering from dehydration and shock. He needs to be rehydrated quickly. The administration of insulin will help to lower the blood glucose level and stop the production of ketone bodies. The administration of IV antibiotics would only be appropriate if there were signs of infection. The administration of IV fluids with oral antidiabetic medications would not be appropriate because the patient is in shock and needs quick correction of his fluid and electrolyte imbalances. The administration of potassium and magnesium is not appropriate at this time because the patient's potassium level is normal and his magnesium level is not provided.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
