    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents to the physician with a blurred vision of her right eye for 2 days. She has pain around her right eye during eye movement. She takes no medications. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 72/min, respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction while illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. The color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dry eyes",
      "B": "High-risk sexual behaviour",
      "C": "Oral ulcers",

  "model_response": "The patient has acute optic neuritis. The most common initial symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) is optic neuritis. It is usually unilateral and may be the initial manifestation of the disease. The risk of MS is increased in patients with a history of optic neuritis. Dry eyes are not associated with optic neuritis. High-risk sexual behaviour is not associated with optic neuritis. Oral ulcers are not associated with optic neuritis. Sensory loss is not associated with optic neuritis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
