    "question": "A 66-year-old male presents to his primary care physician to discuss his increasing shortness of breathover the last 3 months. He notes that this is particularly obvious when he is mowing his lawn or climbing the stairs in his home. His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is well-controlled with lisinopril. His vital signs are as follows: T 37.6 C, HR 88, BP 136/58, RR 18, SpO2 97% RA. Physical examination is significant for an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex on auscultation. In addition, an S3 heart sound is also present. Bounding pulses are palpated at the radial arteries bilaterally. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Mitral regurgitation",
      "B": "Aortic regurgitation",
      "C": "Aortic stenosis",
      "D": "Mitral prolapse"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur suggests aortic regurgitation. The presence of a midsystolic murmur at the right upper sternal border suggests aortic stenosis. The presence of a late diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex suggests mitral stenosis. The combination of these murmurs suggests the presence of a mixed valvular-myocardial disease. The most common cause of this constellation of murmurs is hypertension, which leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. The presence of bounding pulses suggests elevated cardiac output and increased stroke volume. The most common cause of elevated cardiac output and increased stroke volume in the presence of these murmurs is aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation results in a diastolic blowing murmur that is decrescendo and is best heard at the left sternal border. Aortic stenosis results in a midsystolic murmur that is best heard at the right upper sternal border. The presence of an S3 heart sound suggests increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume. The combination of aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis is known as aortic regurgitation-stenosis (Austin Flint murmur). The most common cause of aortic regurgitation-stenosis is aortic valve sclerosis. Aortic valve sclerosis is a condition in which the aortic valve leaflets are thickened and calcified without significant narrowing of the valve orifice. Aortic valve sclerosis is a very common condition in the elderly. The presence of a mitral prolapse is suggested by a midsystolic click and a late systolic murmur. The click is best heard at the apex and the murmur is best heard at the left lower sternal border. The presence of an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur suggests aortic regurgitation. The presence of a midsystolic murmur at the right upper sternal border suggests aortic stenosis. The presence of a late diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex suggests mitral stenosis.
