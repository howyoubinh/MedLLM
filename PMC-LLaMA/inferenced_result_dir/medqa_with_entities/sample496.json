    "question": "A 24-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of agitation, confusion, and lethargy. She has also had progressive recurring headaches and visual impairment over the last month. Three days ago, she had a seizure but has not seen a physician. She is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Capillary refill time is more than 3 seconds. Her laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11.2 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 7000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 148 mEq/L\nCl- 100 mEq/L\nK+ 3.8 mEq/L\nHCO3- 26 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen 18 mg/L\nGlucose 90 mg/L\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/L\nOsmolality 300 mOsmol/kg H2O\nUrine osmolality 240 mOsm/kg H2O\nWhich of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased water intake",
      "B": "Increased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion",
      "C": "Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion",
      "D": "Decreased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has central diabetes insipidus secondary to a brain tumor. The increased water intake would lower the serum sodium concentration. The increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion would stimulate the adrenal cortex to secrete more sodium-retaining hormones. The decreased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion would allow more water to be excreted, thus increasing the serum sodium concentration.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
