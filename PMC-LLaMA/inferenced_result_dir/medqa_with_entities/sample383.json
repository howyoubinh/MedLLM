    "question": "A 5-month-old boy is brought to the physician with a 3-day history of fever and cough. His mother reports that he has had multiple episodes of loose stools over the past 3 months. He has been treated for otitis media 4 times and bronchiolitis 3 times since birth. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation, and the neonatal period was uncomplicated. He is at the 10th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 35/min. Examination shows an erythematous scaly rash over his trunk and extremities. The white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa bleed when scraped. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the right lung base. An X-ray of the chest shows an infiltrate in the right lower lobe and an absent thymic shadow. Which of the following is the most likely definitive treatment for this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation",
      "B": "Intravenous immune globulin",
      "C": "Leucovorin supplementation",
      "D": "Thymic transplantation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characterized by multiple serious infections beginning in infancy. SCID is most commonly caused by mutations in the gene encoding the common gamma chain (γc), a protein that is shared by the receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). The γc protein is required for the development of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The thymus is typically absent or markedly underdeveloped. The treatment of choice for SCID is hematopoietic cell transplantation, which replaces the abnormal cells with cells that have a normal γc protein. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be used to treat infections in patients with SCID while awaiting an appropriate donor. Leucovorin supplementation is used in the treatment of patients with a deficiency of adenosine deaminase. Thymic transplantation has been used in the treatment of SCID, but it is not the most definitive treatment.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
