    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5째F (37.5째C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient's dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient's vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5째F (37.5째C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hemolytic anemia and ataxia",
      "B": "Gum disease and poor wound healing",
      "C": "Irregularly irregular heart rhythm",
      "D": "Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is consistent with severe trauma and hemorrhagic shock. The patient's asthma is exacerbated by his trauma and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient's temperature is normal, but his blood pressure and pulse are indicative of shock. The patient's presentation is consistent with an anaphylactoid reaction. The most common cause of anaphylactoid reactions is iodinated contrast dye. The patient's presentation is also consistent with an anaphylactoid reaction to a medication. The patient's presentation is not consistent with a drug-induced lupus erythematosus reaction, which is more common in older patients and is associated with anti-histone antibodies. The patient's presentation is not consistent with a serum sickness reaction, which is more common in older patients and is associated with anti-nuclear antibodies. The patient's presentation is not consistent with a Goodpasture syndrome reaction, which is more common in young men and is associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies. The patient's presentation is not consistent with a post-infectious glomerulonephritis reaction, which is more common in young men and is associated with anti-streptococcal antibodies.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

For a few days of intubation, nasopharyngeal artificial airways are the most commonly used devices, while for longer periods (up to three weeks) endotracheal tubes are the preferred devices.
