    "question": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician requesting prenatal care. For the past 2 months, she has had increasing breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain, and urinary frequency. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She has been trying to conceive with her husband since she stopped taking oral contraceptives 6 months ago; she was happy to tell him last week that she is pregnant. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild, nontender abdominal enlargement. The cervical os is closed. Urine β-hCG is negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Delusion of pregnancy",
      "B": "Pseudocyesis",
      "C": "Pregnancy",
      "D": "Incomplete abortion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are suggestive of pregnancy, but her physical examination and laboratory tests are normal. She is not anemic, and her ultrasonography does not show an intrauterine pregnancy. The term pseudocyesis was coined to describe a psychological condition in which a nonpregnant woman has the sensation of fetal movement and the appearance of pregnancy. The most common presentation is a woman who has recently ended a pregnancy and is nursing, but other women, including those who have had tubal ligations or hysterectomies, have been reported. The incidence is unknown. The woman may have the sensation of fetal movement, and her abdomen may become distended. The pregnancy is a psychological response to a desire to be pregnant. The woman should be informed that she is not pregnant and that she needs psychological help. She should be reassured that her symptoms will resolve. No medical treatment is indicated.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
