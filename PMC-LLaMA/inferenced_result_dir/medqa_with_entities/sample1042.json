    "question": "A 21-year-old man with a past medical history significant for Down syndrome presents to the outpatient primary care clinic for a routine follow up and high risk screening. He is relatively high functioning and currently has no additional significant medical conditions. He feels well and a physical examination shows that he is within normal limits. He denies any current tobacco use, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature, 36.7°C (98.0°F); blood pressure, 126/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; and respiratory rate, 17/min. When considering possible conditions for which this patient is predisposed, which of the following neoplasms is associated with Down syndrome?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Gastric adenocarcinoma",
      "B": "Astrocytoma and cardiac rhabdomyoma",
      "C": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma",
      "D": "Acute lymphocytic leukemia"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is B (Astrocytoma and cardiac rhabdomyoma). Children with Down syndrome are predisposed to the development of certain tumors. The most common tumors in children with Down syndrome are juvenile type of astrocytoma and cardiac rhabdomyoma. Other tumors that occur with increased frequency in children with Down syndrome include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and hepatoblastoma. Gastric adenocarcinoma is more common in individuals with trisomy 21 who have a maternal inheritance of the Barrett esophagus. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is more common in individuals with trisomy 21 who have a paternal inheritance of the Barrett esophagus.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
