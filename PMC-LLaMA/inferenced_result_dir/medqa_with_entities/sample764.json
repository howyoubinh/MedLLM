    "question": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband. She is in active labor and has lost a lot of blood in the past 2 hours, but appears alert and cooperative. At the hospital, her blood pressure is 88/65 mm Hg, the pulse is 110/min, and the respirations are 23/min. Neither the hospital nor the emergency department is equipped for high-risk pregnancies. The patient and her husband request a transfer to a more capable center. They are informed of the hospital’s obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act and the risks of transfer. They insist to be transferred. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

      "A": "Decline admission and refer the patient to the closest capable emergency department",
      "B": "Disregard patient’s request and treat until delivery is complete",
