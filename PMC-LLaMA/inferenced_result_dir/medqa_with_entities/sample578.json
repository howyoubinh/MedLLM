    "question": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty discarding items in her home. She says that the accumulation of things in her kitchen and dining room makes regular use of these spaces incredibly difficult. Her behavior started when she was in high school. She feels anxious when she tries to discard her possessions and her husband tries to clean and organize the home. This behavior frustrates her because most of the items she saves have little emotional or monetary value. She reports that there has been no improvement despite attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for the past 6 months. She now feels that her behavior is “taking over” her life. She does not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is calm, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Her mood is depressed; her speech is organized, logical, and coherent; and there are no psychotic symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Fluoxetine",
      "B": "Lamotrigine",
      "C": "Buspirone",
      "D": "Methylphenidate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms of difficulty discarding items and the sense that her behavior is no longer \"in control\" are characteristic of a diagnosis of hoarding disorder. This is a relatively recently recognized disorder that is characterized by a pattern of acquiring and not discarding items that appear to have little or no monetary or emotional value to the patient. The items themselves often have such little value that they pose a danger to the patient and others (e.g., an accumulation of newspapers and magazines that creates a fire hazard). The disorder is distinct from a delusion of the same content in that the behavior is not solely due to a psychotic process. The disorder is also distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in that the hoarding behavior is not performed as a means to reduce anxiety or to prevent some future feared event. The hoarding behavior is egodystonic, and the patient often recognizes that the behavior is maladaptive. The prevalence of hoarding disorder is unknown, but it is estimated that 1% to 3% of the population may be affected. The disorder usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and tends to run a chronic course. The etiology of hoarding behavior is unknown. There is speculation that it may be a variant of OCD, but this has not been proven. There are no studies regarding the treatment of hoarding disorder. However, in this case, the patient has been undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy for 6 months without improvement. Therefore, it would be appropriate to consider pharmacotherapy. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of OCD. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of OCD. Therefore, an SSRI such as fluoxetine would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.\n\n### END OF TEST###</s><s>",
