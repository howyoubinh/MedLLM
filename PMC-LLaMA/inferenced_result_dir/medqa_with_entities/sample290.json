    "question": "In a study, 2 groups are placed on different statin medications, statin A and statin B. Baseline LDL levels are drawn for each group and are subsequently measured every 3 months for 1 year. Average baseline LDL levels for each group were identical. The group receiving statin A exhibited an 11 mg/dL greater reduction in LDL in comparison to the statin B group. Statistical analysis reports a p-value of 0.052. Which of the following best describes the meaning of this p-value?",
    "options": {
      "A": "If 100 similar experiments were conducted, 5.2 of them would show similar results",
      "B": "There is a 5.2% chance that A is more effective than B is due to chance",
      "C": "There is a 94.8% chance that the difference observed reflects a real difference",
      "D": "This is a statistically significant result"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The p-value of 0.052 means that there is a 5.2% chance that statin A is more effective than statin B is due to chance. In other words, there is a 94.8% chance that the difference observed reflects a real difference.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
