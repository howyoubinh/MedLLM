    "question": "Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?",

      "A": "Convergent validity",
      "B": "Discriminant validity",
      "C": "Negative predictive value",
      "D": "Test specificity"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The use of a lower cut-off point would increase the sensitivity of the test, allowing more infected individuals to be identified. However, it would also decrease the specificity and positive predictive value of the test, leading to an increase in the number of false-positive results. Convergent validity refers to the extent to which two measures of a construct are highly correlated. Discriminant validity refers to the extent to which a measure of a construct is uncorrelated with measures of unrelated constructs.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
