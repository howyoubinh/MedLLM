    "question": "A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inhibition of proteasome",
      "B": "Hyperstabilization of microtubules",
      "C": "Generation of free radicals",
      "D": "Cross-linking of DNA"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has received a single-agent chemotherapeutic regimen, so the most likely mechanism of action of the drug is generation of free radicals. The proteasome is a complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. Inhibition of the proteasome can lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Microtubules are involved in intracellular transport. Hyperstabilization of microtubules can lead to cell cycle arrest. Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent that works by generating DNA cross-links.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
