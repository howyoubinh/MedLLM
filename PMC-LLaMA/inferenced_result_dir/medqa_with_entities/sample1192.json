    "question": "A 19-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department after collapsing during a cheerleading practice session. Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is ‘a fatty’ and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy",
      "B": "In-patient psychiatric therapy",
      "C": "Antidepressants",
      "D": "Appetite stimulants"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is showing signs of anorexia nervosa (AN), which is characterized by self-imposed dietary restrictions leading to a significantly low body weight. The patient denies being underweight and insists that she is overweight. This is a common finding in AN. The patient also shows other features of AN such as fear of gaining weight and an intense desire to be thin. The patient’s behavior of refusing further intravenous fluids and meals is also consistent with AN. The most appropriate long-term management for this patient’s condition is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that is used to treat a variety of disorders, including AN. It is a type of therapy that focuses on changing negative patterns of thinking and behavior that are causing the problem. The goal of CBT is to help the patient recognize and change maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. In-patient psychiatric therapy, antidepressants, and appetite stimulants are not appropriate for the long-term management of this patient’s condition. In-patient psychiatric therapy is reserved for patients who are suicidal, homicidal, or who are unable to care for themselves. Antidepressants are not indicated for the treatment of AN. Appetite stimulants are not recommended for the long-term management of AN.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
