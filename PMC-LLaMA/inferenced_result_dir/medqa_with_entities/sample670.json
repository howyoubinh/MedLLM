    "question": "A medical student is preparing a patient for an appendectomy. He is asked by the surgeon to disinfect the patient’s skin with a chlorhexidine-isopropyl alcohol solution before the procedure. Recent studies have shown that this solution substantially reduces the risk of surgical site infections compared with a povidone-iodine preparation without alcohol in clean-contaminated surgery. Which of the following mechanisms best describes the mechanism of action of chlorhexidine?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Bactericidal at low concentrations",
      "B": "Cell wall damage by free radical release",
      "C": "Attack of free-sulfur amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids within the bacteria",
      "D": "Its activity depends on pH and is greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The activity of chlorhexidine is not greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter. Chlorhexidine is a relatively slow-acting agent that is bactericidal at low concentrations. Its action depends on the ionic nature of the compound, and thus its activity is enhanced at alkaline pH and is greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter. Chlorhexidine has a good safety profile, although it should not be instilled into ears or used in the immediate period after an acid-base balance has been stabilized. Chlorhexidine is an excellent skin antiseptic and is used commonly for this purpose. It is also used as a mouthwash to reduce oral flora. Povidone-iodine, in contrast, is bactericidal at higher concentrations and is more active in the presence of organic material. It acts by attacking free-sulfur amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids within the bacteria. The free iodine within the povidone-iodine preparation is the active component, and its action is enhanced by the addition of an alcohol to the preparation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
