    "question": "A 32-year-old man jumps off a 3 story building during a suicide attempt. Paramedics arrive quickly, and he is taken to the hospital where several stable lumbar fractures and a shattered right calcaneus are found. He undergoes surgery and his calcaneus is repaired with 11 screws. Which of the following statements best describes the long term post-surgery outcome in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "He will not be able to plantar flex his foot.",
      "B": "He will not be able to point his toe.",
      "C": "He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.",
      "D": "He will have pain while dorsiflexing his foot."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The innervation of the calcaneus is the tibial nerve. The tibial nerve innervates the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg, which are responsible for plantar flexion of the foot and for stabilizing the heel during walking. The S1 nerve root also contributes to the innervation of the heel. Therefore, a patient with a calcaneus fracture will not be able to plantar flex his foot. The muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg, which are responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot, are innervated by the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve. The sural nerve innervates the skin on the lateral aspect of the foot. The superficial fibular (peroneal) nerve innervates the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg, which are responsible for eversion of the foot. The saphenous nerve innervates the skin on the medial aspect of the leg and the great saphenous vein.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
