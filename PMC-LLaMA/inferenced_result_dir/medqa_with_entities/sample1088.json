    "question": "A 26-year-old nullipara presents to her physician for a routine check-up at 18 weeks gestation. She has no co-morbidities. Her only complaints are fatigability and a depressed mood for the past 2 weeks. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; respiratory rate, 14/min; and temperature, 36.7℃ (98℉). The physical examination is unremarkable and the gynecologic examination is consistent with 18 weeks gestation. A thyroid profile s ordered to check for a possible cause of the fatigability and decreased mood:\nThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.3 mU/L\nTotal T4 160 nmol/L\nFree T4 13 pmol/L\nCorresponding to the obtained results, how should the patient be managed?",
