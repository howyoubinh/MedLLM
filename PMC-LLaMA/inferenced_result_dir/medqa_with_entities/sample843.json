    "question": "A 79-year-old woman presents to her physician complaining of a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea after contracting a cold in the past month. She describes herself as being “generally healthy” before the cold started. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient takes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Her parents are both deceased. She does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, she described a month-long trip to St. Louis, Missouri, to visit family. At the physician’s office, her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild crepitus on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the right lung which is confirmed on chest computed tomography (CT). A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blastomycosis",
      "B": "Sporotrichosis",
      "C": "Histoplasmosis",
      "D": "Onychomycosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis is a dimorphic fungus that grows as a mold in the environment, but a yeast when it infects humans. Infections are acquired by inhalation of the mold spores found in bird or bat droppings in endemic areas. The yeast phase proliferates in the lungs and then spreads hematogenously to other organs. Most infections are asymptomatic or mild enough not to require treatment. Severe infections are more common in immunocompromised patients or in those with T cell deficiencies. Blastomycosis is caused by a dimorphic fungus that grows as a mold in the environment and as a yeast in humans. Sporotrichosis is a chronic infection involving cutaneous, subcutaneous, and lymphatic tissue. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail, usually caused by dermatophytes. Coccidioidomycosis is caused by a dimorphic fungus endemic to the southwestern United States and Central and South America.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
