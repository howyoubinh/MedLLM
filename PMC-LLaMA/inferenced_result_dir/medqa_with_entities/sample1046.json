    "question": "An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?",
    "options": {
      "A": "30%",
      "B": "15%",
      "C": "95%",
      "D": "99%"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The standard error of the mean (SEmean) is the standard deviation (SD) of the sampling distribution of the mean divided by the square root of the total number of cases. In this example, the SEmean is 0.1 g/dL, and the total number of cases is 100. Therefore, the range of values from the mean (plus or minus 1 SEmean) that includes 95% of the cases would be 17 +- 0.1 g/dL, or 16.9 to 17.1 g/dL. Thus, 95% of the subjects would have hemoglobin concentrations between 16.9 and 17.1 g/dL, and 5% would have concentrations greater than 17.1 g/dL. Therefore, the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL is 5%, or 0.05.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
