    "question": "A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion in addition to a 1-month history of ankle swelling. She has a history of sleep apnea. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema. Cardiac examination shows a widely split S2 that varies with respiration. An ECG shows right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Localized lymphatic obstruction",
      "B": "Thrombus formation in a deep vein",
      "C": "Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure",
      "D": "Decreased plasma oncotic pressure\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has the clinical picture of congestive heart failure (CHF), which is suggested by the bilateral pitting pedal edema, a widely split S2 that varies with respiration, and a right bundle branch block on the ECG. CHF is characterized by increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, which results from the backup of blood into the venous circulation due to the heart's inability to pump an adequate cardiac output. Localized lymphatic obstruction, thrombus formation in a deep vein, and decreased plasma oncotic pressure are not characteristic of CHF.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
