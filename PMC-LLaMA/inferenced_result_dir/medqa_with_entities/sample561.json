    "question": "A 20-year-old woman in the army recruit collapses during an especially hot day at basic training. She was in her normal excellent state of health prior to this event. Two weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory infection (URI) but has since recovered. Her father has chronic kidney disease (CKD), bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems. At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3°C (104.5°F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A mutation of the COL4A5 gene",
      "B": "Neisseria meningitides",
      "C": "Heat stroke",
      "D": "IgA nephropathy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is suffering from a heat stroke. Heat stroke occurs when body temperature regulation fails, resulting in dangerously high body temperature. Heat stroke can be exercise-induced or caused by exposure to high environmental temperatures. The patient's altered mental status, dry skin, and myalgia are consistent with this diagnosis. The tea-colored urine is due to myoglobinuria, which occurs when muscle breakdown products (including myoglobin) are released into the blood and filtered by the kidneys. The absence of RBCs or WBCs in the urine suggests that rhabdomyolysis, rather than a urinary tract infection, is the cause of the myoglobinuria. The patient's father has features suggestive of Alport syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the COL4A5 gene. Neisseria meningitides can cause meningitis, which presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. IgA nephropathy can cause hematuria and proteinuria, but usually follows an upper respiratory infection. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
