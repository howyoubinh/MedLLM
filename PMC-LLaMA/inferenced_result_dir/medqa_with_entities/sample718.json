    "question": "A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of swelling of his legs for 2 months. Three months ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on a new medication. His blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. This patient was most likely treated with which of the following drugs?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Losartan",
      "B": "Spironolactone",
      "C": "Hydrochlorothiazide",
      "D": "Amlodipine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient was most likely treated with a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (losartan). Both of these drugs are effective in treating hypertension. Edema is a common side effect of both of these medications.\n\nSpironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and would be an unlikely choice for initial treatment of hypertension.\n\nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic and would be an unlikely choice for initial treatment of hypertension.\n\nTitrate the dose of the antihypertensive medication until the blood pressure is controlled.\n\nAlso Know:\n\nEdema is a common side effect of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors.\n\nEdema occurs more frequently in patients receiving a calcium channel blocker and a diuretic than in patients receiving either a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic alone.\n\nEdema occurs less frequently in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic than in patients receiving either an ACE inhibitor or a diuretic alone.\n\nReference: Satyanarayana- Biochemistry, 3rd edition, pg-139\n\n###COMMENT: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
