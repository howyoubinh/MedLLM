    "question": "A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a severe headache. She states it is 10/10 in intensity and states that it is associated with chewing. She describes it as a dull pain over the sides of her head. The patient is otherwise healthy and is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 111/74 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that is worsened when the patient opens and closes their mouth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Migraine headache",
      "B": "Temporal arteritis",
      "C": "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction",
      "D": "Tension headache"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. This condition is often misdiagnosed as migraine headache. The pain is typically described as dull and located over the sides of the head. It is worsened with chewing or other jaw movements. The physical examination may reveal tenderness over the joint itself. The patient should respond to ibuprofen or acetaminophen.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
