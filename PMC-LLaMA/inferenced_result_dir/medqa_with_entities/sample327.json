    "question": "A 22-year-old man from Nepal presents to the emergency department complaining of swelling and pain in his right testicle. The patient states that he just arrived in the United States to live with his wife, with whom he is monogamous. The patient denies painful urination or urethral discharge, but admits that 10 days ago he “felt like he had a fever” and the right side of his face was swollen and painful. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine",
      "B": "Original presentation in the form of a painless chancre",
      "C": "Cause buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes",
      "D": "Is a common cause of septic arthritis in this patient’s age group"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s presentation is most consistent with syphilis, which is caused by Treponema pallidum. The spirochete enters the body through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes, and the primary lesion (chancre) appears at the site 10 to 90 days after exposure. The chancre is painless, relatively avascular, circumscribed, indurated, and indistinct. Buboes (swelling in the inguinal lymph nodes) may be present. The spirochetes spread hematogenously to other organs, and the clinical picture can vary greatly. The spirochetes can also spread to the central nervous system (CNS), causing meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Late symptoms of syphilis include paresis, cardiovascular lesions, and tabes dorsalis. The disease can be diagnosed by dark-field microscopy, immunofluorescence, or serology.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
