Syrian Hamsters exhibit multiple coat colors, gold being the most common, and have a life span of about two to three years. Syrian hamsters are extremely territorial and are prone to attacking other hamsters so cannot be housed together under most circumstances. Females come into estrus every four days and embryo gestation is 16-18 days long. Syrian hamsters may exhibit diarrhea, neoplasms, amyloidosis, polycystic disease, and pregnancy-associated toxemia."
