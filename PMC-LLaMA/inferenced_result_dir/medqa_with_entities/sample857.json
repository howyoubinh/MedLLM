    "question": "A 71-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a pigmented lesion on her left foot. She has had decreased appetite and a 6-kg (13-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months. Physical examination shows that on the left medial ankle there is a 2-cm reddish-black nodule with a verrucous surface. A full-thickness excisional biopsy of the lesion shows S100-protein-positive epithelioid cells. A subsequent CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows metastases to the liver; a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma is made. Chemotherapy with aldesleukin is initiated. Which of the following is the mechanism of action for this drug?",

Various cytoplasmic signaling molecules are recruited to the activated receptor complex and become substrates for regulatory enzymes that are associated with the receptor complex. This agent enhances lymphocyte mitogenesis; stimulates long-term growth of human IL-2 dependent cell lines; enhances lymphocyte cytotoxicity; induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell and natural killer (NK) cell activities; and induces expression of interferon-gamma. Aldesleukin may induce T cell-mediated tumor regression in some tumor types."
