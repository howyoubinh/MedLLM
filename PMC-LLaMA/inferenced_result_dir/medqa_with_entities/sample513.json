    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain. The patient states that he has gradually worsening back pain that seems to have worsened after moving furniture the other day. He also states that while he walks, he feels numbness and weakness in his legs. The only time the patient states his back pain is improved is when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store. The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. He drinks 3 alcoholic drinks every day and has a 44 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all 4 directions. Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Compression fracture",
      "B": "Herniated nucleus pulposus",
      "C": "Musculoskeletal strain",
      "D": "Spinal stenosis"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is D: Spinal stenosis. This patient's symptoms of back pain that is worsened by activity and improved by rest, along with the associated numbness and weakness in his legs, are classic for spinal stenosis. The fact that he has a long history of back pain that has worsened over time is also consistent with spinal stenosis. The fact that he has osteoporosis and a smoking history further increases his risk for spinal stenosis. The fact that he has no tenderness on exam and normal mobility in all directions makes a herniated nucleus pulposus or compression fracture less likely. Musculoskeletal strain would be unlikely to cause symptoms that are worse with activity and improved with rest.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
