    "question": "A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing weakness in both legs for 7 days. She also reports a tingling sensation in her legs that is exacerbated by taking a hot shower. She is sexually active with one male partner and does not use condoms. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F). Physical examination shows decreased muscle strength and clonus in both lower extremities. Patellar reflex is 4+ bilaterally and plantar reflex shows an extensor response on both sides. Abdominal reflex is absent. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following findings is most likely to further support the diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum",
      "B": "Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy",
      "C": "Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation",
      "D": "Identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical findings and MRI are consistent with a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). This is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that can follow many different types of infections, including those caused by Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The MRI shows multiple high signal intensities in both cerebral hemispheres on the T2-weighted image. The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are not specific for any one type of infection. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows a pleocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes. The CSF protein is usually elevated, and the glucose level is usually normal. The CSF is not likely to show a positive response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen, which is a finding in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins are found in patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a demyelinating disease that occurs in immunocompromised patients, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The CSF is not likely to show immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation in this patient. This finding is more typical of Guillain-Barre syndrome. The CSF is not likely to show the presence of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture. This finding is more typical of bacterial meningitis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
