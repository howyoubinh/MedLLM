    "question": "A 26-year-old woman developed rapidly progressive septic shock associated with nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura. She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski's signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis. Which one of the cytokines below takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tumor necrosis factor-α",
      "B": "Interleukin-5",
      "C": "Interleukin-12",
      "D": "Interleukin-4"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The development of septic shock is associated with the release of several inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. TNF-α is one of the earliest mediators produced in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It induces other cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8), activates neutrophils, and increases the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
