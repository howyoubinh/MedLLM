    "question": "A 27-year-old female presents to her physician with a palpable thyroid nodule. Iodine uptake testing shows that the nodule has decreased iodine uptake compared with the rest of the thyroid gland. A fine-needle aspiration is performed and the physician calls telling the patient that she has a neoplasm of the thyroid. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Papillary carcinoma",
      "B": "Medullary carcinoma",
      "C": "Follicular carcinoma",
      "D": "Anaplastic carcinoma"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a cold nodule of the thyroid, which is more likely to be malignant than a hot nodule. Papillary carcinoma is the most common thyroid malignancy, accounting for about 80% of cases. It is more common in women and in younger age groups. The disease is usually unifocal. The cells have nuclei with characteristic grooves, and psammoma bodies may be present. Papillary carcinoma has an excellent prognosis, with a greater than 95% 10-year survival rate. Medullary carcinoma (choice B) is derived from the parafollicular cells and is associated with elevated serum calcitonin levels. It occurs in multiple endocrine neoplasia type II. Follicular carcinoma (choice C) is more common in iodine-deficient areas. It tends to be more aggressive than papillary carcinoma, with a 5-year survival rate of only 50-70%. Anaplastic carcinoma (choice D) is usually fatal within a few months of presentation. It is more common in older age groups.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
