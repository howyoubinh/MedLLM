    "question": "A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Random assortment",

    }
  },
  "model_response": "This sequence is a complementary DNA (cDNA) probe that hybridizes to the variable region of the T-cell receptor (TCR) b chain locus. The variable region of the TCR b chain loci undergoes random nucleotide addition and, therefore, sequence variability, in order to generate the tremendous antigen-specific receptor repertoire characteristic of T cells. The cDNA probe is generated from mRNA isolated from the T cells, which is then reverse-transcribed to cDNA and randomly fragmented. The variable region of the TCR b chain locus is then amplified by PCR using the cDNA as a template and a set of TCR b chain-specific primers. The primers are complementary to sequences flanking the variable region but not within the variable region itself. The amplified products are then run through a gel matrix and probed with the labeled cDNA probe. The probe binds to any band that has a variable region complementary to the probe, and the band can then be excised from the gel and further analyzed. The variable region of the TCR b chain locus is composed of three regions: the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments. The V and J segments are randomly recombined within the T cell during development, and the D segment is then randomly added to the V-J rearrangement. The tremendous repertoire of T cells is generated by the random addition of nucleotides to the V and J segments. This process is distinct from the random assortment or haphazard sorting of T cells that occurs in the thymus, where T cells with receptors that cannot bind to self MHC are eliminated. Isotype switching, which occurs in both B and T cells, involves the rearrangement of the constant (C) region genes, not the variable regions. VDJ recombination is the process by which the variable regions of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains are generated during B-cell development.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
