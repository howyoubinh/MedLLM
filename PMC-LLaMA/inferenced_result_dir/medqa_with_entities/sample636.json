    "question": "A 2-day-old boy delivered at 34 weeks gestation is found to have a murmur on routine exam. He is lying supine and is not cyanotic. He has a pulse of 195/min, and respirations of 59/min. He is found to have a nonradiating continuous machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. S1 and S2 are normal. The peripheral pulses are bounding. Assuming this patient has no other cardiovascular defects, what is the most appropriate treatment?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Indomethacin",
      "B": "Thiazide diuretic",
      "C": "Aspirin",
      "D": "Penicillin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient most likely has a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The continuous machine-like murmur is characteristic. The bounding pulses are secondary to the wide pulse pressure caused by the runoff from the aorta to the ductus. The treatment of choice in a full-term infant without other cardiovascular anomalies is indomethacin. This medication will close the ductus in the majority of patients. If the ductus does not close after 48 hours of indomethacin therapy, surgical ligation and division should be performed. In premature infants, indomethacin may not close the ductus, and surgical intervention may be required at a later time. In older children, the ductus can be closed by open surgical or catheter techniques.\n\nThiazide diuretics are used in the treatment of hypeension and fluid retention. Aspirin is used in the treatment of Kawasaki disease. Penicillin is used in the treatment of infective endocarditis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
