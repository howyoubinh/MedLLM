    "question": "A patient with a1-antitrypsin deficiency is warned by his physician that his increasing dyspnea may be worsened by his continued cigarette smoking. Which of the following factors, released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, is responsible for the patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Major Basic Protein",
      "B": "Mucus",
      "C": "Surfactant",
      "D": "Elastase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The neutrophil has a number of substances in its granules, including a variety of enzymes. The major basic protein is one such enzyme, which is released by neutrophils and is also found in the azurophilic granules of the granulocyte. This enzyme is capable of destroying bacteria, but it is also capable of destroying lung tissue. The inhibitor that is missing in this patient will, therefore, allow the enzyme to attack the lung tissue, resulting in the dyspnea. The mucus is secreted by the goblet cells in the airway epithelium and is not related to the enzyme. Surfactant is secreted by the type II pneumocytes in the alveoli and is necessary for normal lung function. It is not related to the enzyme. Elastase is an enzyme secreted by the neutrophil and is capable of digesting lung tissue. It is not related to the enzyme.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
