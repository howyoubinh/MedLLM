    "question": "A 60-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her daughter for evaluation. The daughter reports that her mother has recently been having difficulty combing her hair in the mornings. The patient’s family history is significant for an ischemic stroke in her father. The patient’s past medical history is positive for diverticulosis. She takes no medication. Her blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). On physical examination, the patient’s neck is stiff and she also has bilateral shoulder tenderness; muscle strength is intact. Laboratory work is performed and presented below:\nHemoglobin 12.9 g/dL\nHematocrit 37.7% \nLeukocyte count 5,500/mm3\nNeutrophils 65%\nLymphocytes 30%\nMonocytes 5%\nMean corpuscular volume 82.2 μm3\nPlatelet count 190,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 65 mm/h\nC-reactive protein 44 mg/dL\nFor which of the symptoms below should the patient be screened?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Jaw claudication",

    }

  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms of morning stiffness and tenderness in the shoulder suggest polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The classic symptom of jaw claudication, while not present in this patient, is a hallmark symptom of PMR. The rash of heliotrope is seen in dermatomyositis, a condition that may be associated with PMR. The patient’s age and diverticulosis are risk factors for colon cancer, and gastroesophageal reflux can be a side effect of PMR therapy.\n\nThe correct answer is D. Pink plaques with silvery scales are characteristic of psoriasis, which can be associated with a form of inflammatory arthritis called psoriatic arthritis.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are consistent with a normocytic, normochromic anemia. The leukocyte count is mildly elevated with a left shift, suggesting an inflammatory process. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is markedly elevated, suggesting an inflammatory process. The C-reactive protein is also elevated, suggesting an inflammatory process.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of dermatomyositis. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera. The hematocrit is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of polymyositis. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of vasculitis. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The leukocyte count is not elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not markedly elevated.\n\nThe patient’s laboratory results are not consistent with a diagnosis of Behcet’s disease.
