    "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in April for seasonal allergies. She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alpha-adrenergic antagonism",
      "B": "Beta-adrenergic antagonism",
      "C": "Relative lipophobicity",
      "D": "Serotonergic antagonism"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. Fexofenadine is an antihistamine that is less sedating than diphenhydramine. One reason for this difference is that fexofenadine lacks alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. Diphenhydramine has significant alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, which contributes to its sedating effect. Fexofenadine is a racemic mixture and has relatively low lipophilicity. This makes it less likely to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and less likely to cause sedation. Fexofenadine is a less potent inhibitor of serotonin receptors than diphenhydramine. This difference is not clinically significant.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

In addition fexofenadine may also inhibit the late-phase allergic reaction by acting on leukotrienes or prostaglandins, or by producing an anti-platelet activating factor effect. Overall, this agent blocks the actions of endogenous histamine, thereby leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms associated with histamine and achieve effects such as decreased vascular permeability, reduction of pruritus and localized smooth muscle relaxation."
