    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician after discovering a painless mass in the left testicle. Results from tumor markers and a biopsy are as follows:\nAFP 350 ng/mL (normal value < 10 ng/mL)\nhCG 0.4 IU/L (normal value < 0.5 IU/L)\nBiopsy: Presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Classic seminoma",
      "B": "Choriocarcinoma",
      "C": "Teratoma",
      "D": "Yolk sac tumor"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells, is characteristic of teratoma. Teratomas are composed of a variety of parenchymal cell types that are derived from one or more of the 3 germ layers. They are composed of tissues such as hair, muscle, and cailage. Teratomas are typically mature and benign.\n\nThe other choices are not correct. Classic seminomas are composed of sheets of uniform polygonal or round cells with clear cytoplasm and central nuclei. Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumor that is composed of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Yolk sac tumor is composed of cells that resemble those in the primitive yolk sac.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
