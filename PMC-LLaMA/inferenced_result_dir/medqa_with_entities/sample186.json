    "question": "A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. In order to do so, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. Which of the following will most likely occur?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The ribosome will recognize the mischarged tRNA and prevent its incorporation by removing the valine",
      "B": "The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine",
      "C": "The mischarged tRNA will be degraded by the proteasome",
      "D": "The mischarged tRNA will be removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The ribosome will recognize the mischarged tRNA and prevent its incorporation by removing the valine. The ribosome binds to the charged tRNA and transfers it to the correct position on the mRNA sequence. The ribosome will recognize that the tRNA is mischarged and will not allow the valine to be incorporated into the growing peptide. The tRNA will be removed from the ribosome and either degraded or recycled. The lysyl-tRNA synthetase is responsible for attaching the correct amino acid to the tRNA, and would not be involved in removing a mischarged tRNA. The proteasome is a degradative enzyme complex and would not be involved in the initial recognition of a mischarged tRNA.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
