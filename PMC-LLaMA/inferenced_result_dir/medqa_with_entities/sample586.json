The mass is most likely derived from which of the following types of cells?",

The different types of pituitary cells (or anterior pituitary hormones) are:\n\nLactotrophs (prolactin)\nSomatotrophs (growth hormone)\nCorticotrophs (ACTH)\nThyrotrophs (TSH)\nGonadotrophs (FSH, LH)\n\nThese cells are derived from Rathke's pouch, an ectodermal outpouching from the stomodeum in the developing embryo.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
