    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with dry cough, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever that began 6 days ago. He also reports that he has had 3 episodes of watery diarrhea per day for the last 2 days. He appears slightly pale. His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 65/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 140/78 mm Hg. Diffuse crackles are heard over bibasilar lung fields. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.8 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 16,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 150,000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 131 mEq/L\nCl-\n102 mEq/L\nK+ 4.7 mEq/L\nHCO3- 26 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen 18 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.2 mg/dL\nAn x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\"",

The treatment of choice for legionellosis is azithromycin or a respiratory quinolone. The patient's diarrhea suggests the possibility of concurrent legionella diarrhea or a superimposed enteritis. The treatment of choice for legionella diarrhea is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The patient should also be given an anti-legionella antibody.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
