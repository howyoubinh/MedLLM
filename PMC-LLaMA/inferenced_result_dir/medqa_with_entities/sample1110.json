    "question": "A previously healthy 16-year-old boy comes to the physician because of a 5-day history of pain at the back of his left ankle. His mother had a myocardial infarction at 54 years. His BMI is 23 kg/m2. There is tenderness above the left posterior calcaneus and a firm, 3-cm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the left Achilles tendon. A photomicrograph from a biopsy of the nodule is shown. Serum studies in this patient are most likely to show increased levels of which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Rheumatoid factor",
      "B": "Angiotensin converting enzyme",
      "C": "Low-density lipoprotein",
      "D": "Triglycerides"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a painless nodule over the left Achilles tendon that is most likely a ganglion. These benign cysts are most common over the dorsal wrist, but they can occur near tendon insertions anywhere in the body. They are firm and usually move with motion in the nearby joint. They are more common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, presumably because of immune dysregulation. The only complication is rupture, which can be associated with pain and swelling. The histologic appearance of a ganglion is that of a cyst filled with collagen. Ganglions are not inflammatory lesions, and rheumatoid factor is not present. Angiotensin converting enzyme is increased in sarcoidosis, which can cause ankle and heel pain. Low-density lipoprotein is increased in atherosclerosis, which can cause calf claudication. Triglycerides are increased in familial hyperchylomicronemia, which can cause painful nodules over the elbows and knees.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
