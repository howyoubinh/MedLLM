    "question": "A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pain. He reports that one hour ago he was climbing the stairs in his home when he suddenly developed excruciating chest pain. He describes the pain as ripping and radiating to the back. The patient’s past medical history is significant for a heart murmur that is being followed by his outpatient cardiologist. He takes no medications. The patient works as a carpenter and reports being monogamous with his wife. He denies any history of intravenous drug use or recent travel. In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature is 99.4°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 94/56 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to be in moderate distress and is clutching his chest. He is tall and has joint hypermobility. His breath sounds are equal and full bilaterally and has weak distal pulses.\n\nWhich of the following is most likely to be found in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border",
      "B": "Late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex with mid-systolic click",
      "C": "Mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border",
      "D": "Systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with acute aortic regurgitation. The most likely cause of acute aortic regurgitation in a young, otherwise healthy individual is aortic root dilation or aortic dissection. The murmur associated with aortic regurgitation is a high-pitched, blowing, decrescendo murmur heard at the left lower sternal border. The murmur of aortic regurgitation is different from the murmur of aortic stenosis. The murmur of aortic stenosis is an ejection systolic murmur that is harsh sounding and is best heard at the right second intercostal space. A late systolic crescendo murmur with mid-systolic click is characteristic of mitral valve prolapse. A mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is characteristic of aortic stenosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
