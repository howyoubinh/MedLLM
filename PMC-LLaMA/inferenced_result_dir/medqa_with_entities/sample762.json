    "question": "A 57-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for follow-up of his diabetes. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago and has been started on metformin and lifestyle modifications. The patient does not have any current complaints except for occasional numbness in both hands and feet. His HbA1C is 8.5% and serum glucose is 240 mg/dL. Which of the following is the best next step in this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Start basal-bolus insulin",
      "B": "Continue metformin monotherapy",
      "C": "Add a sulfonylurea",
      "D": "Add a thiazolidinedione"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s HbA1C of 8.5% indicates poor glycemic control and the need for additional therapy. The patient’s symptoms of numbness are likely a result of hyperglycemia. Therefore, the best next step in this patient’s condition would be to add a second medication to his treatment regimen. Since he has only been on his current regimen for 3 months, it would be reasonable to wait before starting basal-bolus insulin or switching to an alternative oral medication. Therefore, option B, continuing metformin monotherapy, is the best choice.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
