    "question": "A 70-year-old woman with no significant medical history begins to experience memory loss and personality changes. Over the next few months, her symptoms become more severe, as she experiences rapid mental deterioration. She also starts to have sudden, jerking movements in response to being startled and gait disturbances. Eventually, she lapses into a coma and dies eight months after the onset of symptoms. What process likely caused this woman's illness?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.",
      "B": "Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination of the peripheral nervous system.",
      "C": "Conversion of a protein from an a-helix to a ß-pleated form, which resists degradation.",
      "D": "Frontotemporal atrophy and the accumulation of intracellular, aggregated tau protein."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation is characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is caused by the accumulation of intracellular, aggregated tau protein. CJD is a rare, degenerative, and invariably fatal brain disorder that is sporadic in about 85% of cases. The disease is associated with deposition of abnormal forms (i.e., ß-pleated sheets) of tau protein in the brain. Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes the cytoskeleton by catalyzing the assembly and disassembly of microtubules. The accumulation of tau protein results in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. CJD is associated with dementia, memory loss, and changes in personality, as well as with motor dysfunction (e.g., jerking movements, ataxia, and gait disturbances). The disease is fatal within a year of the onset of symptoms. None of the other choices are associated with the clinical presentation described.Diagnosis: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
