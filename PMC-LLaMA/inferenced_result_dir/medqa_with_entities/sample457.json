    "question": "A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with a history of black, tarry stools but denies vomiting of blood or abdominal pain. His family has noticed progressive confusion. History is significant for liver cirrhosis and alcoholism. His heart rate is 112/min, temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, he is jaundiced, lethargic, is oriented to person and place but not date, and has moderate ascites. Neurological examination reveals asterixis, and his stool is guaiac-positive. Liver function test are shown below:\nTotal albumin 2 g/dL\nProthrombin time 9 seconds\nTotal bilirubin 5 mg/dL\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 100 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 220 U/L\nWhich of the following is a feature of this patient condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis",
      "B": "It is a diagnosis of exclusion",
      "C": "It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis",
      "D": "Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localising abnormality"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis. The clinical syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy is characterised by changes in mental status, personality, and neuromuscular function. The degree of elevation of the blood ammonia level, the extent of liver failure, and the duration of the neurological abnormality are the most important factors in the development of encephalopathy. Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localising abnormality. The syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy is diagnosed clinically. There are no specific diagnostic tests. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical findings.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
