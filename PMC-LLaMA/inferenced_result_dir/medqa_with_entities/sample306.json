    "question": "A 61-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of abdominal pain and constipation. He reports a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain. He has had one small bowel movement in 4 days. Normally he has a bowel movement once a day. His medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 beers per day. His diet consists primarily of fast food. His temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient’s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses. This patient’s condition is most strongly associated with which of the following disorders?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency",
      "B": "Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder",
      "C": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome",
      "D": "Goodpasture syndrome"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation is most consistent with sigmoid volvulus. The radiographic findings of a sigmoid volvulus are often sufficiently characteristic to preclude the need for further studies. On a plain radiograph of the abdomen, a sigmoid volvulus appears as an inveed U-shaped loop of bowel, with the convexity of the loop lying in the right upper quadrant (opposite the site of obstruction). The loop may be quite large, causing a mass effect on the adjacent abdominal organs and structures. Sigmoid volvulus is a cause of large bowel obstruction and is most common in elderly patients. The condition is associated with a high mortality rate, largely because of the age and comorbid conditions of the patients who are most at risk for developing it. Predisposing factors include a high-residue diet, chronic constipation, and a history of laxative use. The chronic use of laxatives is thought to lead to the development of a long, floppy, untethered segment of sigmoid colon that is predisposed to volvulus. The diagnosis is usually made radiographically. Barium enema is often used to make the diagnosis. Surgery is indicated for sigmoid volvulus because of the high risk of ischemia and perforation. The other choices are not associated with an increased risk of sigmoid volvulus. Choice A, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, is associated with the development of emphysema and liver disease. Choice B, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, is associated with the development of renal failure. Choice C, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, is associated with the development of colonic intussusception. Choice D, Goodpasture syndrome, is associated with the development of renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
