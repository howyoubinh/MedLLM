    "question": "A 24-year-old man with chronic back pain comes to the physician to establish care after moving to Florida. He complains of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea for three days. He denies smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illicit drugs. He appears restless. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 150/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection. His abdominal exam shows diffuse mild tenderness. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,000/mm, and platelet count is 250,000/mm3; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Lorazepam",
      "B": "Naltrexone",
      "C": "Methadone",
      "D": "Naloxone\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with opioid toxicity. Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that displaces the opioid from its receptor sites and reverses its effects. It is a short-acting drug with a plasma half-life of 60-90 min. Naloxone is the antidote of choice for opioid overdose. The dose should be titrated to reversal of respiratory depression. If the dose is titrated carefully, the risk of withdrawal in chronic users is minimal. Lorazepam is a sedative-hypnotic that is not an opioid antagonist. Naltrexone is an orally available opioid antagonist used for maintenance therapy in opioid addicts. Methadone is a synthetic narcotic that is used for maintenance therapy in opioid addicts.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
