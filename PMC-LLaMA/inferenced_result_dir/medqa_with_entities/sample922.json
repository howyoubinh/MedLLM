    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent skin lesions. The episodes of lesions started at the age of 2 months and multiple treatment options have been attempted without success. He has also had several episodes of respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. The boy attends daycare. His older brother has asthma. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. He appears ill. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows several raised, erythematous lesions of different sizes over the face, neck, groins, and extremities; some secrete pus. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chronic granulomatous disease",
      "B": "Atopic dermatitis",
      "C": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome",
      "D": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a disorder of phagocytes. Patients are prone to recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms (e.g., S. aureus). The lymph nodes in CGD are often enlarged, and granulomas may be seen. The classic form of CGD is X-linked; the gene for NADPH oxidase in neutrophils and macrophages is mutated. The result is that these cells cannot produce reactive oxygen species. The other choices do not include a defect in phagocytic cells.\n\nWiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and a marked vulnerability to recurrent infection, particularly of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Patients have reduced IgM levels and increased IgA and IgE levels. There is a defect in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, which links several membrane receptors to the cytoskeleton.\n\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that usually begins in infancy or childhood. It is characterized by itching, inflammation, and crusting of the skin. Patients with atopic dermatitis have an increased incidence of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The cause of atopic dermatitis is unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors play a role.\n\nChediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by partial albinism, recurrent infections, and peripheral neuropathy. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the LYST gene, which encodes a protein involved in lysosomal trafficking.\n\nSturge-Weber syndrome is characterized by a facial port-wine stain, usually in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, and angiomatous engorgement of the cerebral cortex. Seizures and mental retardation are common. The cause is a mutation in the GNAQ gene on chromosome 3.\n\nHemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of factor VIII. Hemophilia A is characterized by a prolonged PTT and a normal PT. Patients with hemophilia A are prone to bleeding, particularly in joints and muscle.\n\nGiuffre G, Rodeghiero F.
