    "question": "A 25-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck for the past week. He reports no recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which was diagnosed last year. He also experienced a head trauma 5 years ago, which has been complicated by residual seizures. His only medication is daily phenytoin, which was restarted after he had a seizure 3 months ago. His temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 40 mm/h\nAn excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed. The histopathologic analysis is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)",
      "B": "Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL)",
      "C": "HIV lymphadenopathy",
      "D": "Phenytoin-induced adenopathy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "###Rationale: The histopathologic slide shows a classic Reed-Sternberg (RS) cell, which is a large, hyperchromatic, bilobed nucleus with prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasm is abundant and pale. These cells are usually found in a sea of B cells, which are small lymphocytes with round nuclei and condensed chromatin. This is a diagnostic of classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL). The RS cell is found within a reactive cellular environment consisting of variable proportions of lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells. The RS cell is derived from the germinal or post-germinal center B cell and is not pathognomonic for HL, as it can be seen in infectious mononucleosis and other mimics. The RS cell in HL is usually found in a sea of B cells, which are small lymphocytes with round nuclei and condensed chromatin. Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) would show a predominance of immature lymphoid cells on the slide. HIV lymphadenopathy would show a predominance of small lymphocytes with dispersed chromatin. Phenytoin-induced adenopathy would show a predominance of histiocytes with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
