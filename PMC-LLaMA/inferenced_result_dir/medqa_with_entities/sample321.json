    "question": "A 55-year-old man recovering from knee replacement surgery complains of breathlessness in the postoperative ward. He has been confined to bed for the past 5 days and is under observation. He felt a sudden difficulty in breathing and called for the ward nurse. He says that he is unable to take deep breaths and has a sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.8°F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 31/min, and the blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. He experiences pain in his right calf on dorsiflexion. There are no other prominent findings on physical examination. His chest X-ray does not show anything significant. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best course of management at this time?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Subcutaneous fondaparinux",
      "B": "Inferior vena cava filter",
      "C": "Ventilation-perfusion scan",
      "D": "Lower extremity doppler"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a high clinical probability of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) based on his history and physical findings. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a venous duplex ultrasound examination of the lower extremities to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for DVT. Initial therapy usually consists of heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux. Initial treatment with unfractionated heparin is usually monitored with aPTT, and the dose is adjusted to maintain the aPTT at 1.5 to 2 times control. Initial treatment with low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux is usually administered in a weight-based dosage and does not require aPTT monitoring. Unfractionated heparin can be administered by continuous IV infusion or by subcutaneous injection. Low molecular weight heparin and fondaparinux are typically administered subcutaneously. Warfarin should be started as soon as possible in addition to the initial parenteral therapy. The patient should be treated for at least 3 months. The risk of recurrent DVT is highest during the first week of therapy. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are indicated for patients with contraindications to anticoagulation or recurrent venous thrombosis despite intensive anticoagulation. A ventilation-perfusion scan is used to investigate the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. A lower extremity doppler is used to investigate for the presence of a deep venous thrombosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
