    "question": "A 42-year-old man with AIDS comes to the physician for intermittent fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and a 3.6-kg (8-lb) weight loss over the past month. He has not seen a doctor since he became uninsured 2 years ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. The liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 1–2 cm below the left costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 49/mm3 (N ≥ 500 mm3). Blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms. A PPD skin test shows 4 mm of induration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Voriconazole",
      "B": "Amphotericin B and itraconazole",
      "C": "Erythromycin",
      "D": "Azithromycin and ethambutol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, which is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. Treatment consists of combination therapy with rifabutin, ethambutol, and one of the newer macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin). Voriconazole is an extended spectrum azole used to treat invasive fungal infections. Amphotericin B is an antifungal agent used to treat systemic fungal infections. Erythromycin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.\n\n###COMMENT:\n\nRifabutin is the preferred agent for the treatment of MAC infection. It is given at a dosage of 300 mg/d. Clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) or azithromycin (500 mg once daily) is given with rifabutin. Ethambutol (15 mg/kg/d) is added if the patient does not respond to the macrolide-rifabutin combination.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
