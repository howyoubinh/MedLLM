    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow up appointment. He was released from the hospital 1 week ago for an appropriately managed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); however, he has not filled any of his prescriptions and did not attend his follow up appointment as scheduled. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 167/118 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Echocardiography demonstrates an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following medications will have the greatest mortality benefit in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Atenolol",
      "B": "Lisinopril",
      "C": "Metoprolol succinate",
      "D": "Propranolol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of heart failure. The most important medication for this patient is a beta blocker. Beta blockers have been shown to decrease mortality in patients with heart failure. Atenolol, metoprolol succinate, and carvedilol are all beta blockers that have been shown to decrease mortality in patients with heart failure. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has been shown to decrease hospitalizations for heart failure and death from progressive heart failure. However, the data do not support a decrease in all-cause mortality with the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure. Propranolol is a nonselective beta blocker that has been shown to decrease hospitalizations for heart failure and death from progressive heart failure. However, the data do not support a decrease in all-cause mortality with the use of nonselective beta blockers in patients with heart failure.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
