    "question": "An 8-year-old boy who recently immigrated to the United States presents with a rash. Past medical history is significant for a recent sore throat which caused him to miss several days at school. The patient’s vaccination status is unknown. On physical examination, the patient is pale and ill-looking. There are pink rings present on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs. Cardiac exam is significant for a holosystolic murmur heard best over the apex of the heart. Which of the following histopathologic findings is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear",
      "B": "Starry sky appearance",
      "C": "Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystal deposits",
      "D": "Granulomas with giant cells"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has rheumatic fever, which is a sequela of untreated infection with group A Streptococcus. The classic cardiac lesion is mitral regurgitation, which is heard as a holosystolic murmur. Atypical lymphocytes are found in the blood during acute rheumatic fever. The starry sky appearance is seen with bacterial endocarditis. The other choices are not associated with rheumatic fever.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
