    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency room due to progressive dyspnea. She is a known hypertensive but is poorly compliant with medications. The patient claims to have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is prominent neck vein distention. An S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema were also detected. A 2d echo was performed, which showed a decreased ejection fraction (32%). Which of the following drugs should not be given to this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Furosemide",
      "B": "Nesiritide",
      "C": "Metoprolol",
      "D": "Digoxin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This is a case of acute heart failure exacerbation. The patient has rales and S3 gallop, which are signs of pulmonary edema. The patient has also evidence of poor perfusion (neck vein distention, low blood pressure). The patient has a low ejection fraction (32%), which indicates systolic heart failure. The initial treatment of acute heart failure is the administration of intravenous fluids. However, in this case, the patient has evidence of fluid overload (neck vein distention, pulmonary edema). Therefore, the use of intravenous fluids is contraindicated. Loop diuretics are the mainstay of therapy in acute heart failure. However, in this case, the patient has evidence of fluid overload and low blood pressure. Therefore, the use of loop diuretics is contraindicated. Nesiritide is a recombinant BNP that dilates the aerial and venous circulation. It also has a positive inotropic effect. Nesiritide is indicated in acute heart failure exacerbation with evidence of low perfusion. In this case, the patient has evidence of low perfusion (neck vein distention, low blood pressure). Therefore, nesiritide is the drug of choice. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker indicated in acute heart failure exacerbation. However, in this case, the patient has evidence of low perfusion, and beta-blockers are contraindicated in this setting. Therefore, metoprolol is contraindicated. Digoxin is indicated in acute heart failure exacerbation. However, in this case, the patient has evidence of low perfusion, and digoxin is contraindicated in this setting. Therefore, digoxin is contraindicated. Furosemide is a loop diuretic indicated in acute heart failure exacerbation. However, in this case, the patient has evidence of fluid overload and low blood pressure. Therefore, furosemide is contraindicated.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
