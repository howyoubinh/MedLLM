    "question": "A 24-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room (ER) by her co-workers after they found her unconscious in her cubicle when they returned from lunch. They tell you that she has diabetes but do not know anything more about her condition. The woman’s vital signs include: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 24/min, temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is breathing heavily and gives irrelevant responses to questions. The skin and mucous membranes appear dry. Examination of the abdomen reveals mild diffuse tenderness to palpation. Deep tendon reflexes in the extremities are 1+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nFinger stick glucose 630 mg/dL\nArterial blood gas analysis:\npH 7.1\nPO2 90 mm Hg\nPCO2 33 mm Hg\nHCO3 8 mEq/L\nSerum:\nSodium 135 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.1 mEq/L\nChloride 136 mEq/L\nBlood urea nitrogen 20 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL\nUrine examination shows:\nGlucose Positive\nKetones Positive\nLeukocytes Negative\nNitrite Negative\nRBCs Negative\nCasts Negative\nThe patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Infuse NaHCO3 slowly",
      "B": "Switch fluids to 0.45% NaCl",
      "C": "Start IV insulin infusion",
      "D": "Replace potassium intravenously"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a state of absolute or relative insulin deficiency and is characterized by an anion gap metabolic acidosis due to ketone body production. The treatment of DKA includes insulin replacement to inhibit ketogenesis and glucose oxidation, correction of dehydration with normal saline, and correction of electrolyte imbalance, especially hypokalemia. Bicarbonate replacement is controversial and some experts recommend not replacing bicarbonate unless the pH falls below 7.1. IV regular insulin is given in a bolus dose of 0.1 U/kg IV, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 U/kg/h, with the goal of lowering the blood glucose by 50-75 mg/dL/h. The normal saline is isotonic (0.9% NaCl) and should not be changed.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

These curtains usually consist of a piece of fabric hung from a ceiling track. Cubicle curtains are manually or power operated; they can come in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials (e.g., cotton, polyester, nylon, vinyl).
