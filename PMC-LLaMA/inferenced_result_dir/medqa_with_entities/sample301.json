    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of decreased appetite and abdominal pain for the last several weeks. Physical examination shows a well-appearing toddler with a palpable left-sided abdominal mass that does not cross the midline. A CT of the abdomen shows a large, necrotic tumor on the left kidney. Histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This tissue is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Adrenal medulla",
      "B": "Thyroid gland",
      "C": "Papillary muscles",
      "D": "Anterior pituitary\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The kidney is derived from the metanephros, which is the most cranial of the three embryonic renal structures. The other embryonic renal structures are the pronephros and mesonephros. The pronephros is rudimentary in humans, but is the forerunner of the mesonephric kidney in other species. The mesonephros is the site of urine formation in the early embryo, but regresses before birth. The anterior pituitary is derived from an outgrowth of the diencephalon, as are the adrenal medulla and thyroid gland. Papillary muscles are derived from the myocardium.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
