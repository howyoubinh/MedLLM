    "question": "A 67-year-woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma comes to the physician because of progressively increasing numbness and tingling in her fingers and toes. Her last cycle of chemotherapy with vincristine was 1 week ago. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch in all distal extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are decreased. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s peripheral neuropathy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization",
      "B": "Creation of free radicals that unwind DNA",
      "C": "Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase",
      "D": "Incorporation of false pyrimidine analogues into DNA"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient’s peripheral neuropathy is an example of a dose-limiting toxicity of vincristine. Vincristine inhibits the formation of microtubules in cells by binding to and inhibiting the function of the polymerization of tubulin, a process necessary for the formation of microtubules. This disruption of microtubule formation inhibits cell division and can lead to apoptosis of the cell. The other choices are mechanisms of action of other classes of chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
