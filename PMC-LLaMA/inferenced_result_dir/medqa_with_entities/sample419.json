    "question": "A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration over his thighs and external genitalia. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. Three days ago, he was started on treatment with warfarin. His only other medications are metformin and lisinopril. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 108/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 155/89 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows large purpura, hemorrhagic bullae, and areas of skin necrosis over his anterior legs, gluteal region, and penis. This patient is most likely to benefit from treatment with which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hyperbaric oxygen",
      "B": "Protein C concentrate",
      "C": "Argatroban",
      "D": "Tranexamic acid"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is experiencing a warfarin-induced \"purple toe\" syndrome, which can occur 3 to 10 days after initiation of therapy. It is due to cholesterol embolization from disruption of the endothelium. Treatment is suppoive, and in most cases, the disorder clears within several weeks as the warfarin is metabolized. In severe cases, exchange transfusion or plasmapheresis may be indicated. Warfarin should be withheld and replaced with heparin. Unfractionated heparin is preferred because it can be discontinued quickly if bleeding complications develop. Warfarin should not be restarted for at least 1 week. Hyperbaric oxygen may be beneficial in severe cases. Protein C concentrate is used in the treatment of thrombosis. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor used in the treatment of thrombosis. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent used to control bleeding.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
