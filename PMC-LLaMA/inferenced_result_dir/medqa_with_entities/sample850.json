    "question": "A 55-year-old construction worker is struck by a high-voltage power line while on duty. According to bystanders, the cable struck him on his right arm, after which the man slumped to the ground with his arms and legs shaking. In the emergency department, the man is alert but in severe pain localizing bilaterally in the flanks as well as in his right arm where contact with the power line occurred. A 6 cm burn is present on the right arm. His vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea at 21/min. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be conducted first to evaluate this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "FAST ultrasound assessment",
      "B": "Urinalysis",
      "C": "X-ray of the arm and shoulder",
      "D": "EEG"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient is at risk for both neurologic injury and rhabdomyolysis from the contact with the power line. The neurologic injury could cause a seizure, and the rhabdomyolysis could cause acute renal failure. Therefore, the first diagnostic test should be a FAST ultrasound assessment to rule out intra-abdominal bleeding. The other diagnostic tests listed could be considered later, but the patient's presenting symptoms and injuries suggest that the first priority should be assessment of the abdomen.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
