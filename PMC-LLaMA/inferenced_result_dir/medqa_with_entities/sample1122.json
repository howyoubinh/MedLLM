    "question": "A 63-year-old man presents to the clinic for left calf pain when walking a distance of more than 200 m. He has had this pain for more than 8 months now, and he rates it as 7 out of 10. The pain subsides with rest. The patient has had a history of diabetes mellitus for the past 2 years which is well controlled. A percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 2014. His current medications are insulin and aspirin. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease. He has an 80 pack-year history of smoking and currently smokes. He consumes 4 drinks per day of alcohol. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 144/89 mm Hg, the heart rate is 80/min and regular, the breathing rate is 25/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. Normal cardiac and lung sounds were heard on auscultation. Which of the following is the appropriate treatment to improve the patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Cilostazol",
      "B": "Femoral embolectomy",
      "C": "Femoral-to-popliteal bypass graft",
      "D": "Interventional endovascular treatment"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The pain occurs with exercise and resolves with rest. The patient has risk factors for PAD including diabetes, smoking, and hypertension. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor that acts to increase vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation. It has been shown to increase the distance of pain-free ambulation. The other options are treatments for more severe disease. Femoral embolectomy is performed for acute arterial occlusion. Femoral-to-popliteal bypass graft is performed for severe claudication that does not respond to medical therapy. Interventional endovascular treatment includes angioplasty and stenting for severe stenosis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
