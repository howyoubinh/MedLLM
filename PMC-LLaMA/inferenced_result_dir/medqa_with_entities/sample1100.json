    "question": "A 2-day-old infant male is brought to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of vomiting and irritability. He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus",
      "B": "Produces lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide",

      "D": "Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees"

  "model_response": "The patient most likely has early-onset sepsis, which is most commonly caused by group B streptococci (GBS). GBS is part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract and female genital tract. It can cause early-onset (within 7 days) or late-onset (after 7 days) sepsis. Early-onset sepsis presents with poor feeding, lethargy, hypotonia, and irritability. It can progress to respiratory distress, hypoperfusion, and shock. Late-onset sepsis presents with meningitis. GBS is a gram-positive bacillus that is beta-hemolytic and optochin-sensitive. It can be distinguished from other streptococci by its growth in 5% NaCl. GBS produces a polysaccharide capsule that is antiphagocytic. It can also produce a variety of exotoxins, but the exact role of these toxins in pathogenesis is unclear. The lipooligosaccharide of GBS has endotoxic activity, but this is not characteristic of all GBS strains. The most virulent strains of GBS produce a C5a peptidase that inhibits the chemotactic response of neutrophils. The C5a peptidase of GBS is an example of a virulence factor that inhibits the complement system. The A and B toxins of Clostridium tetani are neurotoxins that increase cAMP and cGMP levels, respectively. Bacillus anthracis produces a toxin that increases cAMP levels. The A and B toxins of Corynebacterium diphtheriae are neurotoxins that increase cAMP and cGMP levels, respectively. The A toxin of Bordetella pertussis is a neurotoxin that increases cAMP levels. The A toxin of B. anthracis is a neurotoxin that increases cAMP levels. The A toxin of B. cereus is a neurotoxin that increases cAMP levels. The A toxin of B. thuringiensis is a neurotoxin that increases cGMP levels. The A toxin of B. pseudomallei is a neurotoxin that increases cGMP levels. The A toxin of B. pertussis is a neurotoxin that increases cGMP levels. The A toxin of C. difficile is a neurotoxin that increases cGMP levels. The A toxin of C. tetani is a neurotoxin that increases cGMP levels. The A toxin of C. sordellii is a neurotoxin that increases cGMP levels. The A toxin of C. botulinum is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. difficile is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. perfringens is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. sordellii is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. botulinum is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. tetani is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. difficile is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. perfringens is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. sordellii is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. botulinum is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. tetani is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C. difficile is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine. The A toxin of C.",
