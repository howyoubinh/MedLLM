    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of mild left-sided abdominal pain when lifting heavy objects that has developed over the past 6 months. He has had a weight loss of 41 kgs (90 lbs) in the past year. Physical examination shows a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel on the left. A CT scan of the abdomen of a patient with the same condition is shown. Which of the following muscles is located directly medial to the pathology seen on the CT scan?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Psoas major",
      "B": "External oblique",
      "C": "Rectus abdominis",
      "D": "Transverse abdominal\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The CT scan shows a cross-sectional view of the abdomen, with the left kidney and pancreas seen on the left side of the image. The bulge inferior and lateral to the navel is likely an epigastric hernia. The hernia is protruding through the linea alba, which is formed by the aponeuroses of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominal muscles. The psoas major muscle is located more inferiorly and medially in the abdominal wall. The rectus abdominis and transverse abdominal muscles are located more superficially. The external oblique muscle is located laterally.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
