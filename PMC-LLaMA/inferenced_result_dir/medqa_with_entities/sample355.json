    "question": "A 32-year-old G1P1 patient presents to her obstetrician after having a positive pregnancy test at home. She reports that she and her husband had been trying to have a child for the past three months. She has no history of sexually transmitted disease, intravenous drug use, or blood transfusions, and she has never traveled outside of the United States. She was up-to-date on all immunizations before her pregnancy. Ultrasound is consistent with an 8-week gestational sac. The patient requests as few tests as possible, although she does not want to compromise the health of her fetus. Which of the following screening tests should be performed on all pregnant women?",
