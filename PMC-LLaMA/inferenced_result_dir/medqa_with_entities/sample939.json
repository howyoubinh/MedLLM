    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Examination shows erythema with scaling on both cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds and two 1-cm ulcers in the oral cavity. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decreased lymphocyte count",
      "B": "Increased platelet count",
      "C": "Increased prothrombin time",
      "D": "Decreased gamma globulin"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings are those of Sjogren syndrome, an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to xerostomia and xerophthalmia. The disease is associated with autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and Sjogren syndrome. The initial laboratory findings are those of a nonspecific inflammatory response, with leukopenia, lymphopenia, and an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Later, the patient may develop a lymphoproliferative disorder, with increased levels of IgA and IgG and a positive test for rheumatoid factor.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
