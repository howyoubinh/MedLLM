    "question": "A 14-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and is found on ultrasound to have a gallstone. Based on clinical suspicion, a CBC, a Coombs test, and a bilirubin panel are obtained to determine the etiology of the gallstone. These tests reveal a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis as well as an increased RDW. In addition there is an indirect hyperbilirubinemia and the Coombs test results are negative. To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution. In this patient, what findings would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Hypersegmented neutrophils",
      "B": "Sideroblasts",
      "C": "Spherocytes",
      "D": "Dacrocytes"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of an increased reticulocyte count, an increased RDW, and a negative Coombs test are all consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. The increased osmotic fragility further supports this diagnosis. The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils would suggest a myeloproliferative disorder such as chronic myelogenous leukemia. The presence of sideroblasts would suggest a myelodysplastic disorder. The presence of spherocytes is consistent with hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or the presence of a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone. The presence of dacrocytes (tear-drop cells) would suggest a myelodysplastic disorder.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
