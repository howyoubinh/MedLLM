    "question": "A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. Six months ago, she was vaccinated against influenza. Her last mammography 1 year ago showed no abnormalities. Two years ago, a pap smear and colonoscopy were normal. She has a history of hypertension. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 50 years. She emigrated from Japan 30 years ago. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the last 18 years. She drinks 4â€“5 glasses of wine per day. She goes ballroom dancing twice each week. Her medications include enalapril and low-dose aspirin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a soft S4 gallop. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Pap smear",
      "B": "Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry",
      "C": "Abdominal ultrasonography",
      "D": "Transesophageal echocardiography"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's age and history of smoking place her at risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). The absence of abnormalities on cardiopulmonary examination and resting ECG does not exclude CAD. Exercise ECG (stress test) is less sensitive than exercise echocardiography or exercise radionuclide imaging for detecting CAD. Exercise echocardiography is generally more sensitive than exercise radionuclide imaging for detecting CAD. However, in this case, exercise echocardiography is not an option. Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry is used to estimate bone mineral density and is not relevant here. Abdominal ultrasonography is not indicated in the absence of abdominal complaints. Pap smear is important for this sexually active woman, but it is not as important as screening for CAD. Transesophageal echocardiography is not indicated in the absence of symptoms such as dysphagia or unexplained weight loss. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is stress testing.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
