    "question": "A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of retrosternal chest pain. He describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. He has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are aspirin, simvastatin, metformin, and enalapril. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 33 years. On arrival, his pulse is 136/min and irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Coronary angiogram",
      "B": "Intravenous esmolol",
      "C": "Intravenous amiodarone",
      "D": "Synchronized cardioversion"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "ECG reveals atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Choice B is ruled out as it is used for rate control. Choice C is ruled out as it is used for chemical cardioversion. Choice A is ruled out as it is invasive procedure and can be done later if patient is not responding to medical therapy. Choice D is ruled out as it is done in hemodynamically stable patients.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management is intravenous esmolol.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
