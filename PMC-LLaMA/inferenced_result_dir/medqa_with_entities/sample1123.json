    "question": "A 72-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, and myalgias. Physical examination shows pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye. Laboratory studies show an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm/h. Temporal artery biopsy shows transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids is begun. The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?",

      "B": "Lower extremity gangrene",

  "model_response": "The greatest risk for this patient is development of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Aortic aneurysms are found in as many as 50% of untreated cases of giant cell arteritis. The aneurysms are typically saccular and can be detected by chest x-ray, CT, or MRI. They can also be diagnosed by temporal artery biopsy, which, in the appropriate clinical context, is considered diagnostic for giant cell arteritis. The other choices are not complications of giant cell arteritis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
