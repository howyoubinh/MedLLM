    "question": "A 47-year-old woman presents to a physician for evaluation of vomiting and diarrhea for 2 days. Her symptoms began following a company picnic a few days ago. Initially, she was unable to tolerate any solids or liquids by mouth, but now has been able to drink sips of water. She had a mild headache, which was relieved with acetaminophen. The past medical history is unremarkable. She does not take any medications. The blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg and the heart rate is 60/min. On examination, the mucous membranes are dry and the eyes are slightly sunken. Where is most of the sodium reabsorbed in this patientâ€™s kidneys?",
