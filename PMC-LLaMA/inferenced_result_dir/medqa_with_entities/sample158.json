    "question": "A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals. He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:\nNa+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.2 mEq/L\nCl- 102 mEq/L\nHCO3- 25 mEq/L\nMg2+ 1.7 mEq/L\nPhosphorus 4.3 mg/dL\n25-hydroxyvitamin D 20 ng/mL (N: 20-100 ng/mL)\nParathyroid hormone 115 pg/mL\nTotal bilirubin, serum 0.7 mg/dL\nAlanine aminotransferase, serum 14 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase, serum 15 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase, serum 42 U/L\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?\"",
