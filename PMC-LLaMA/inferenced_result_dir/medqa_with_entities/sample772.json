    "question": "A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of several weeks of intense itching, particularly localized around his anus. Of note, the patient denies any recent travel, sexual contacts, fever, dysuria, or diarrhea. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 12/min. On exam, the patient demonstrates severe excoriations in his perianal region with slight erythema over the areas that are torn. He does not have any other dermatologic findings. The scotch tape test is positive. The patient has a previous documented allergy to albendazole. Which of the following is an alternative medication that can be used?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amphotericin B",
      "B": "Ivermectin",
      "C": "Praziquantel",
      "D": "Pyrantel pamoate"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis). The most common symptom is pruritus, which is often worse at night. The diagnosis is made by identifying eggs or adult worms in stool samples. Adult worms may be identified on the perianal skin using the scotch tape test. Pinworms are treated with albendazole, mebendazole, or pyrantel pamoate. Albendazole and mebendazole are contraindicated in patients with a history of neurocysticercosis. Pyrantel pamoate is the drug of choice for this patient because he is allergic to albendazole and mebendazole. Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication. Ivermectin is used to treat onchocerciasis, strongyloidiasis, and pediculosis. Praziquantel is used to treat schistosomiasis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
