    "question": "A 64-year-old man with multiple sclerosis comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of urinary incontinence. The urge to urinate occurs suddenly, and he often is unable to make it to the bathroom before leaking urine. He has no incontinence with coughing or laughing. Digital rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a normal post-void residual volume. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's incontinence?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Midodrine",
      "B": "Rivastigmine",
      "C": "Mirtazapine",
      "D": "Tolterodine"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Midodrine, an a-agonist, is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's urinary incontinence. Urge incontinence, which is the involuntary loss of urine associated with a strong desire to urinate, is the most common type of incontinence in older men and women. It is often related to detrusor or bladder instability and can be treated with anticholinergic agents such as tolterodine or oxybutynin. However, because this patient has multiple sclerosis, he may have detrusor hyperreflexia related to spinal cord involvement. In such cases, treatment with midodrine, an a-agonist that helps to control bladder hyperreflexia, may be effective. In addition, because this patient has no post-void residual volume, he does not have detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, which is another common cause of urinary incontinence in patients with multiple sclerosis. Rivastigmine is used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

The usual pattern is one of recurrent attacks followed by partial recovery (see MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, RELAPSING-REMITTING), but acute fulminating and chronic progressive forms (see MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE) also occur.
