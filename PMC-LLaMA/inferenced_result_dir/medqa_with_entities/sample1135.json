    "question": "A 23-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of anorexia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and dark-colored urine. He recently returned from a trip to Belize. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). Physical examination shows scleral icterus and tender hepatomegaly. Serum studies show markedly elevated transaminases and anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies. In this patient, infected cells express more MHC class I molecules on their surfaces. This cellular event is primarily induced by a molecule that is also responsible for which of the following changes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Upregulated expression of exogenously synthesized antigens",
      "B": "Enhanced macrophage phagocytic function",
      "C": "Activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2",
      "D": "Increased breakdown of intracellular RNA"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has hepatitis A, which is caused by a small RNA virus. The virus is detected in the liver by the presence of anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies in the serum. The virus is spread by the fecal-oral route. The virus infects the liver and causes lysis of the hepatocytes. The release of the intracellular RNA of the hepatocytes into the cytoplasm is sensed by Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) and TLR-8. This binding of the viral RNA to the TLRs activates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). The activation of eIF-2 causes the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor and the general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) protein. GCN2 is a kinase that phosphorylates and activates the translation of a number of proteins, including the MHC class I proteins. The increased expression of MHC class I proteins allows the presentation of the viral peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which can kill the infected hepatocytes. The increased expression of MHC class I proteins is also a consequence of the increased breakdown of intracellular RNA in the infected cells. The increased breakdown of intracellular RNA leads to increased synthesis of both mRNA and rRNA. The increased synthesis of mRNA leads to increased protein synthesis, which can be used for the increased expression of MHC class I proteins. The increased expression of MHC class I proteins is not due to the increased expression of exogenously synthesized antigens, which is a feature of viral infections such as adenovirus and cytomegalovirus. The increased expression of MHC class I proteins is not due to enhanced macrophage phagocytic function, which is a feature of viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus. The increased expression of MHC class I proteins is not due to the activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, which is a feature of viral infections such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
