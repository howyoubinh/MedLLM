    "question": "A pediatrician notices that 9 of her patients this year have developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. They range in age from 7 to 11, and most of them had no abnormal activities prior to developing the paralysis. These patients concern her because she has not seen this type of paralytic illness in over 20 years of practice. Based on this experience, she decides to write up the initial presentation and clinical course of these patients and publish them in a journal. Which of the following is most likely true about this study?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Different interventions with 2 or more variables can be studied",
      "B": "Hypothesis testing cannot be performed",
      "C": "It should be reported in terms of odds ratio",
      "D": "Participants act as their own controls"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This is a case series, which is a descriptive study. It is not possible to test a hypothesis using this type of study. It is also not possible to calculate an odds ratio. The other options are incorrect because a case series does not involve interventions and does not have a comparison or control group.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
