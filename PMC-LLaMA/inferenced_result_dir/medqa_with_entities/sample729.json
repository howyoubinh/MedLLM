    "question": "A 6-week-old male infant is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting. Vomiting occurs almost immediately after most feeds. Each time, he becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation and weighed 3300 g (7 lb 4 oz); he currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). He has Down syndrome. His vaccinations are up-to-date. He appears agitated and cries during the examination. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 156/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 100/49 mm Hg. Examination shows upward slanting of the eyelids, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a single transverse palmar crease on both hands. The abdomen is soft and nontender. A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray",
      "B": "Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA)",
      "C": "Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound",
      "D": "Tripple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The findings described are characteristic of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound examination, which shows an elongated and thickened pylorus. The etiology is unknown. The incidence is 1:300 to 1:1000 live births, with males (especially firstborns) more commonly affected. The incidence is higher in infants born of younger mothers and lower in those born of older mothers. There is an increased incidence in infants born of mothers who received oxytocin during delivery. The diagnosis is usually made between 3 and 6 weeks of age. Projectile nonbilious vomiting is the rule. The infants usually feed vigorously between episodes of vomiting. Typically, the pyloric mass is palpated on physical examination. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound examination. The differential diagnosis includes preterm and postterm elective surgeries, duodenal atresia, annular pancreas, annular pyloric stenosis, and gastroesophageal reflux. The treatment is surgical pyloromyotomy.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

Cardiac and gastrointestinal malformations, a marked increase in the incidence of LEUKEMIA, and the early onset of ALZHEIMER DISEASE are also associated with this condition. Pathologic features include the development of NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES in neurons and the deposition of AMYLOID BETA-PROTEIN, similar to the pathology of ALZHEIMER DISEASE.
