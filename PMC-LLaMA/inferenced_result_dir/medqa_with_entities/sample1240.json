    "question": "A 3-year-old male was brought to the pediatrician with severe lip lacerations, with a portion of his tongue appearing to be bitten off, as well as missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. A family history is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid. Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?",
    "options": {
      "A": "X-linked recessive",
      "B": "X-linked dominant",
      "C": "Autosomal dominant",
      "D": "Maternally inherited mitochondrial defect"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The mode of inheritance for this disorder is X-linked recessive. The affected male has a defective hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which is responsible for the salvage of purines. This results in the accumulation of purines, which are then metabolized to uric acid. X-linked recessive inheritance is characterized by the following: Males are more frequently affected than females. The carrier female is usually asymptomatic. The affected male does not transmit the disorder to his sons, but all daughters are carriers.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
