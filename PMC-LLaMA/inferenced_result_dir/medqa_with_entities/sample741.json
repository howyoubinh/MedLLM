    "question": "A researcher conducts multiple experiments to establish an infection and disease model for Clostridium perfringens in chickens. To ensure that all instruments are free of the pathogenic organism, he uses a disinfectant that oxidizes and denatures proteins. Which of the following disinfectants did the researcher most likely use?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chlorine dioxide",
      "B": "Isopropyl alcohol",
      "C": "Povidone-iodine",
      "D": "Benzalkonium chloride"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "{'A': 'Chlorine dioxide' is correct.\n\nChlorine dioxide is a potent disinfectant that can be used for sterilization of heat-sensitive items. It is used to sterilize dental and surgical instruments, and for fumigation of rooms and buildings. It is unstable, and must be generated on site for use. It is a powerful oxidizing agent that destroys proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids.\n\n'B': Isopropyl alcohol is a bacteriostatic, saturating the cell membrane and denaturing proteins.\n\n'C': Povidone-iodine is an iodophor, a complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). It is used as a skin antiseptic and in surgical scrubs.\n\n'D': Benzalkonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound, and is bacteriostatic, not cidal. It acts by binding to the cell membrane and disrupting the integrity of the cell.\n}\n</s><s>",
