    "question": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of severe muscle and joint pain for 5 months. The pain varies in location and intensity. She also has joint stiffness in the morning and reports fatigue throughout the day that she attributes to not sleeping well. She reports a tingling sensation in her lower limbs. Her bowel habits are unchanged but she often feels bloated. She has primary hypertension and occasional migraine headaches. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her medications include propranolol and sumatriptan. She appears healthy. Examination shows symmetric muscular tenderness at the base of the neck, over the shoulders, and in the lumbosacral area. Strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 14.3 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 9300/mm3\nPlatelet count 230,000/mm3\nMean corpuscular volume 85 μm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 12 mm/h\nSerum\nGlucose 92 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.6 mg/dL\nTSH 3.1 μU/mL\nUrinalysis is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Temazepam",
      "B": "Vitamin B12",
      "C": "Amitriptyline",
      "D": "Methotrexate\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The symptoms of the patient are suggestive of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome of musculoskeletal pain and tenderness along with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is based on a thorough history and physical examination. Laboratory and radiographic studies are usually normal. The American College of Rheumatology has established clinical criteria for diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The patient must have widespread musculoskeletal pain for at least 3 months and tenderness in at least 11 of 18 specific points on examination. These points are located over the occiput, neck, low back, and bilateral upper and lower extremities. The symptoms of this patient are suggestive of fibromyalgia. The normal laboratory results rule out other causes of musculoskeletal pain. The patient does not have the sleep, memory, and mood problems of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient does not have enough joint problems to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. The patient does not have enough abnormal laboratory results to diagnose polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient does not have enough abnormal laboratory results to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient does not have enough abnormal laboratory results to diagnose polymyositis. The treatment of fibromyalgia includes patient education, aerobic exercise, and medications for sleep and pain. Patients should be educated about fibromyalgia, its symptoms, and its treatment. They should be reassured that they do not have a progressive disease. Patients should be instructed to engage in aerobic exercise. This should be initiated slowly and may be difficult for patients with this disease. Patients should be cautioned that exercise may exacerbate their symptoms initially but that, over time, they will benefit from it. Medications for sleep and pain should be prescribed. Tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and cyclobenzaprine are commonly used. The patient should be warned that medications may have side effects and may be habit-forming. Temazepam is a benzodiazepine that may be used for sleep. It has the potential for habituation and may worsen symptoms of fibromyalgia. Vitamin B12 is not indicated because the patient's methylmalonic acid is normal. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that may be used for pain. It has anticholinergic side effects and may worsen symptoms of fibromyalgia. Methotrexate is not indicated because the patient's methylmalonic acid is normal. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a disease of older individuals characterized by stiffness and pain in the neck, shoulders, and hips. It is associated with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by symmetric joint pain and swelling. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by arthritis, rash, and many other symptoms. Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by symmetric joint pain and weakness.\n\n### QUESTION REF: 101-102\n\n### ANSWER: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
