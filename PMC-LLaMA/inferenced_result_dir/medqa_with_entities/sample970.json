    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents with feelings of nervousness and anxiety. He mentions that lately, he has been feeling increasingly restless and is unable to control feelings of nervousness pertaining to all his daily tasks. He noticed that these feelings were more prominent in the last 2 months but have been present on and off for the last year. On many occasions, his mind will be racing with thoughts that keep him up at night. During these moments, he finds his heart racing and feels light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out. He has also been experiencing back and neck pain with increased muscle tension in these areas. The patient reports no smoking or alcohol use but mentions that he had tried cocaine and heroin in his 20s and 30s. Which of the following would be the best course of treatment for this patient’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Diazepam",
      "B": "Ramelteon",
      "C": "Buspirone",
      "D": "Alprazolam"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are suggestive of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The course of treatment for GAD includes psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Psychotherapy can be in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT). Pharmacotherapy includes the use of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium); non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, such as buspirone (Buspar); and sedative hypnotics, such as ramelteon (Rozerem). However, given the chronicity of the patient’s symptoms and the fact that he has tried cocaine and heroin in the past, the best course of treatment for this patient’s symptoms would be diazepam to help with his acute anxiety symptoms and referral to a substance abuse counselor for further management of his substance abuse issues.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
