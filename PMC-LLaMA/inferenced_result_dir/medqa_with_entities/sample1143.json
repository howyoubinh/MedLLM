    "question": "A 27-year-old man and his wife come to the physician for preconception genetic counseling. The patient and his wife are asymptomatic and have no history of serious illness. The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. Genetic testing in the patient's family shows that his mother is not a carrier of the mutation that is responsible for the disease in his relatives. A pedigree chart of the patient's family is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Variable expressivity",
      "B": "Maternal uniparental disomy",
      "C": "Gonadal mosaicism",
      "D": "Incomplete penetrance"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is an example of a person with germline mosaicism. His somatic cells carry two different populations of gametes, one carrying the normal allele and the other carrying the mutant allele. Because the mutation is not present in the normal allele, the patient is unaffected. The disease in his nephew is due to a somatic mutation in a cell in which both alleles are mutant. The disease in the patient's brother is due to homozygosity for the mutation, since the mutation is present in both alleles of the gene.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
