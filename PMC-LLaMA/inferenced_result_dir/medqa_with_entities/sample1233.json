    "question": "A 30-year-old Japanese woman is brought to the emergency department after fainting at work. She says she was only unconscious for a moment and recovered quickly. She reports increasing fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and her temperature is 36.6°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, the patient is fully conscious. Her radial pulse is absent at her right wrist and 1+ at her left wrist. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin: 10.9 g/dL\nHematocrit: 34.7%\nLeukocyte count: 5,500/mm3\nNeutrophils: 65%\nLymphocytes: 30%\nMonocytes: 5%\nMean corpuscular volume: 78.2 μm3\nPlatelet count: 190,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate: 56 mm/h\nWhat complications is this patient at risk for?",

The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level is low, suggesting a myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient is at risk for myocardial infarction, tongue infarction, palpable purpura, and polyneuropathy.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
