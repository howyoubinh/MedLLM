    "question": "A 45-year-old G3P3 presents complaining of the feeling of a foreign body in her vagina that worsens on standing. She does not have urinary or fecal incontinence or any other genitourinary symptoms. She has no known gynecologic diseases. There were no complications with her pregnancies, all of which were full-term vaginal deliveries. She is sexually active with her husband and no longer uses oral contraceptives. She has an 11 pack-year history of smoking. Her weight is 79 kg (174 lb) and her height is 155 cm (5 ft). Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination is unremarkable. The gynecologic examination reveals descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus. On Valsalva and standing, the cervix descents to the plane of the hymen. The uterus is not enlarged and the ovaries are non-palpable. Which of the following treatments is most reasonable to offer this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Support pessary",
      "B": "Space-filling pessary",
      "C": "Posterior colporrhaphy",
      "D": "Sacral colpopexy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient has a cystocele, cystourethrocele, and uterine prolapse. The cystocele and cystourethrocele are causing the feeling of a foreign body in the vagina. The uterine prolapse is classified as 2nd degree since the cervix descends halfway towards the introitus on Valsalva and standing. The treatment of choice for this patient is a sacral colpopexy. This procedure involves the attachment of the vaginal apex to the anterior longitudinal ligament of the sacrum. The success rate for this procedure is greater than 90% and the complication rate is less than 10%. A space-filling pessary may be offered to this patient as a temporary measure while she is waiting for surgery. A space-filling pessary will likely be unacceptable to her since it will remind her of the foreign body sensation. A postoperative pessary may be used after a sacral colpopexy. A posterior colporrhaphy is not indicated in this patient since her cervix is not enlarged. A pubocervical fascia repair is not indicated since her cervix does not descend beyond the hymen on Valsalva or when standing.\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
