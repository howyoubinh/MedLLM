    "question": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a painless lump on her neck for 3 months that has increased in size. She appears healthy. Examination shows a 2.5-cm (1-in) firm, irregular swelling on the left side of the neck that moves with swallowing. There is painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound of the neck shows a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy is scheduled for the following week. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid",
      "B": "HÃ¼rthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid",
      "C": "Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid",
      "D": "Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The clinical presentation is most consistent with papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. The increased vascularity and punctate echogenic regions are suspicious for malignancy. The other choices are not associated with painless cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
