    "question": "A 22-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of left lower abdominal pain that began suddenly while she was running. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the left adnexa and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant. There is no tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Urine pregnancy test is negative. An ultrasound is ordered to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst. Visualization of fluid in which of the following locations would be most consistent with this diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Rectouterine pouch",
      "B": "Hepatorenal space",
      "C": "Splenorenal angle",
      "D": "Rectovesical pouch"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The rectouterine pouch is the most dependent portion of the peritoneal cavity in the supine position. Fluid from a ruptured ovarian cyst would tend to collect in this location. The hepatorenal space is the most dependent location in the erect position. The splenorenal angle is the location of the tail of the pancreas and is not a likely site for fluid collection. The rectovesical pouch is the location of the appendix and is not a likely site for fluid collection.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
