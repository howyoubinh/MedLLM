    "question": "An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman is found to have T-score of -2.6 SD on routine bone mineral density screening. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago and treated with medroxyprogesterone. Menarche started at 11 years of age and her last menstrual period was 8 years ago. Her last mammography and PAP smear 6 months ago showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not have any children. Current medications include lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment is begun with a drug that prevents further bone resorption and reduces her risk of developing breast cancer. This drug puts her at an increased risk of which of the following adverse effects?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Skin infections",
      "B": "Osteosarcoma",
      "C": "Hypercholesterolemia",
      "D": "Deep vein thrombosis\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's T-score of -2.6 places her in the osteoporotic range. The drug she was started on is alendronate, a bisphosphonate. One of the side effects of these medications is esophageal irritation and even ulceration. The patient should be instructed to take the medication with a full glass of water and remain upright for at least 30 minutes after taking the dose. The other side effect of concern in this patient is the increased risk of osteosarcoma. This is a rare malignancy, but one associated with osteoporosis and treatment with bisphosphonates. The other choices are not complications of bisphosphonate therapy.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
