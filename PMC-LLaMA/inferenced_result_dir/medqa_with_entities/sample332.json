    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness, which have lasted for the past 3 hours. He was diagnosed with heart failure 1 year ago. During his last visit to his primary care physician, he was doing well and the lab results were normal. He reports that he has been taking low-dose aspirin and digoxin regularly for 1 year, and verapamil was recently added to prevent his frequent migraine headaches. An electrocardiogram is performed urgently and shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8â€“2 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Drug-induced hypokalemia",
      "B": "Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin",
      "C": "Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme",
      "D": "Inhibition of P-glycoprotein"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "Ans. D. Inhibition of P-glycoproteinDigitalis toxicity is an adverse effect of digoxin, which can be caused by drug interactions that inhibit the P-glycoprotein efflux pump responsible for the elimination of digoxin. Inhibition of CYP 3A4 would increase the metabolism of digoxin and lower serum levels of digoxin. Drug-induced hypokalemia can precipitate digitalis toxicity, but this is not the most likely mechanism in this case because the patient was doing well on his medications at his last visit to the primary care physician. An increase in intestinal absorption of digoxin would increase serum levels of digoxin, not toxicity.\n\n###COMMENT: This question is a bit of a trap because the most likely mechanism of toxicity is inhibition of P-glycoprotein, which is not provided among the options. The other mechanisms listed are less likely causes of toxicity.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
