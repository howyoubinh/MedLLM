    "question": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of 1-day history of nausea and weakness. She has no history of serious illness. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses an oral contraceptive; she uses condoms inconsistently. Her last menstrual period was 4 days ago. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 13,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 18 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nGlucose 95 mg/dL\nC-reactive protein 16.4 mg/L (N=0.08–3.1)\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\"",
    "options": {
      "A": "Urinalysis",
      "B": "Cervical swab",
      "C": "Blood culture",
      "D": "CT scan of the abdomen\n\""
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is D. This patient has acute pyelonephritis. The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity. The patient should be instructed to give a clean-catch, midstream urine sample. The patient should be started empirically on intravenous fluids, antipyretics, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes acute pyelonephritis, acute cystitis, and acute glomerulonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis is an infection of the renal parenchyma. The most common etiologic agents are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Enterobacter. The most common clinical presentation is fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, and flank pain. The most common laboratory findings are leukocytosis, pyuria, and hematuria. The most common radiologic finding is a urinary tract abnormality, such as a renal calculus or urinary tract obstruction.\n\nAcute cystitis is an infection of the bladder. The most common etiologic agents are E coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus. The most common clinical presentation is dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain. The most common laboratory findings are pyuria and hematuria.\n\nAcute glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomeruli. The most common etiologic agents are immune complexes. The most common clinical presentation is hematuria, proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. The most common laboratory findings are proteinuria, hematuria, and red blood cell casts.\n\nThe diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is made by urinalysis and urine culture. The urinalysis shows pyuria and hematuria. The urine culture will identify the organism and its antibiotic sensitivities.\n\nAn important consideration in the management of this patient is the possibility of pregnancy. The patient denies missing any periods, but this information should be regarded with suspicion, given her sexual activity. The most common symptom of pregnancy is missed menstruation. The most common sign of pregnancy is a positive pregnancy test.\n\nThe next step in management should be a urine pregnancy test. If the test is positive, the patient should be informed that she is pregnant and that she should not take any medications without the knowledge of her obstetrician.\n\nThe patient should be informed that she has acute pyelonephritis and should be started empirically on antibiotics. She should be instructed to return for a follow-up visit if her symptoms do not resolve or if they worsen.\n\n### End of Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
