    "question": "A 1-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for a regular check-up. His weight, height, and head size were found to be in the lower percentile ranges on standard growth curves. His hair is tangled and has a dry, brittle texture. Genetic testing reveals that the patient has a connective tissue disorder caused by impaired copper absorption and transport. The patient’s disorder is caused by a mutation in which of the following genes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "ATP7A",
      "B": "COL5A1",

      "D": "ATP7B"

  },
  "model_response": "The patient has Menkes disease, which is caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene. The gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase that is required for the normal transport and metabolism of copper in the body. Impaired function of this protein leads to copper deficiency, which can cause problems with connective tissue formation and lead to the symptoms described in the question. The other genes listed do not play a role in copper metabolism.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
