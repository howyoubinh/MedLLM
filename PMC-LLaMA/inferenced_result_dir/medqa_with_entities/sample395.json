    "question": "A six-year-old boy with a history of asthma currently uses an albuterol inhaler as needed to manage his asthma symptoms. His mother brings him into your office because she feels she has had to increase the patient’s use of his inhaler to four times per week for the past month. She also reports that he has woken up three times during the night from his symptoms this month. The boy reports that he is upset because he can’t always keep up with his friends in the playground. His past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis. The patient’s temperature is 98°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% O2 on room air. Auscultation of his lungs reveals bilateral late expiratory wheezes.\n\nWhat changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Maintain current therapy",
      "B": "Add fluticasone daily",
      "C": "Add salmeterol twice daily",
      "D": "Add zileuton twice daily"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s asthma symptoms have increased in frequency to the point where he is having nighttime symptoms at least three times per week. He is also having difficulty keeping up with his peers in physical activities. The increase in frequency and severity of his symptoms indicate that his asthma is not under good control. The first step in managing his asthma would be to increase his albuterol inhaler to a daily schedule, rather than as needed. The next step would be to add a long-term control medication to his regimen. Fluticasone is a good choice because it is a corticosteroid that reduces airway inflammation. Adding a long-acting beta-agonist such as salmeterol would also be a good choice. However, since the patient is currently using his albuterol inhaler four times per week, it would be more appropriate to start with a low dose of fluticasone and add the salmeterol later. Adding zileuton would not be a good choice because it is only approved for the treatment of asthma in adults. Adding montelukast would also be a good choice, but it is not available in a nebulizer form so it would not be a good choice for a six-year-old child.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
