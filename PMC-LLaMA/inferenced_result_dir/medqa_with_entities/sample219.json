    "question": "A 4-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a persistent cough, fever, and vomiting. The past year the child has been admitted to the hospital 3 times with pneumonia. For the past 1 week, the child has been experiencing thick purulent cough and says that her chest feels ‘heavy’. Her stools have been loose and foul-smelling over the past week. Her parents are also concerned that she has not gained much weight due to her frequent hospital visits. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On physical exam, the temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). She appears lethargic and uncomfortable. Crackles are heard in the lower lung bases, with dullness to percussion. A small nasal polyp is also present on inspection. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the girl’s symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator",
      "B": "Inefficient breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine",
      "C": "Dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia",
      "D": "Deficiency in lymphocytic activity"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The child’s clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also known as immotile ciliary syndrome. PCD is a genetic disorder characterized by dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The most common presentation is that of chronic cough, sinusitis, and otitis media. Pulmonary infections are characterized by bronchiectasis, atelectasis, and pneumonia. Bronchiectasis can lead to cough with purulent sputum production and can cause hemoptysis. The nasal polyp seen on examination is also consistent with this diagnosis. The other choices are not associated with the symptoms described.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
