    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with continued hypertension despite adherence to multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The physician suspects that the patient may have elevated aldosterone levels and wants to initiate a trial of an aldosterone receptor antagonist. The patient is very concerned about side effects, particularly impotence and gynecomastia, as he had a friend who took a similar medication and had these side-effects. Which of the following is the best medication to initiate, given his concerns and the physician's diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Spironolactone",
      "B": "Eplerenone",
      "C": "Triamterene",
      "D": "Ethacrynic acid"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The physician should initiate treatment with eplerenone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist, in an attempt to control the patient's blood pressure. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist with a higher affinity for the aldosterone receptor, and a lower affinity for the androgen receptor, when compared to spironolactone. This leads to a decreased likelihood of gynecomastia and impotence. Eplerenone is also better tolerated than spironolactone. Triamterene and ethacrynic acid are both potassium-sparing diuretics, and would not address the suspected hyperaldosteronism in this patient.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
