    "question": "A 42-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician for a prenatal care appointment at 10 weeks gestation. The patient recently found out she was pregnant after having unprotected intercourse with her husband for the past year. She states that she is feeling well and has experienced some nausea and vomiting. She is currently taking prenatal vitamins and folate supplements. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you notice a gravid uterus 10 cm above the pubic symphysis. The patient's external genitalia appear within normal limits. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amniocentesis",
      "B": "Cell-free DNA testing",
      "C": "Chorionic villus sampling",
      "D": "Regular follow up appointments"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's age and the duration of time since her last menstrual period make her at an increased risk for having a fetus with Down syndrome. The most accurate way to diagnose Down syndrome in a fetus is through genetic testing, which can be done either through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Cell-free DNA testing is a new non-invasive test that can also be used to diagnose Down syndrome, but it is not as accurate as either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Chorionic villus sampling is usually performed earlier in pregnancy, between 10 and 13 weeks gestation, so it is not the best choice in this case because the patient is only 10 weeks gestation. Regular follow-up appointments and ultrasounds are not as accurate as genetic testing in diagnosing Down syndrome.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
