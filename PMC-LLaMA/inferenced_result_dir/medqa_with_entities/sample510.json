She is currently unemployed and lives in a low-income neighborhood with her 3 children. For the past 3 years, her HIV RNA viral load was undetectable, but last week, her viral load was 8,391 copies/mL (N < 50). Current medications include dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine. On questioning, she says that she misses her medications every other day. Which of the following responses by the physician is most appropriate?",
