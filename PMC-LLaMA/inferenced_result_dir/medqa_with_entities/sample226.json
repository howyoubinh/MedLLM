    "question": "A 51-year-old man presents for a routine check-up. He has no complaints. At his last annual visit, his physical and laboratory tests were unremarkable. His past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, well managed with rosuvastatin, and hypertension, well managed with hydrochlorothiazide. His current medications also include aspirin. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. His laboratory tests are significant for the following:\nWBC 29,500/mm3\nHematocrit 26.1%\nHemoglobin 9.1 g/dL\nPlatelet count 298,000/mm3\nA peripheral blood smear and differential shows 92% small normocytic lymphocytes. The patient’s diagnosis in confirmed by bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry. He is monitored through regular follow-up visits. Three years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presents with swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes, unintentional weight loss of 4.5 kg (approx. 10 lb), and “rib pain” on his right side. On physical examination, there is palpable, firm, non-tender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally. He also has moderate splenomegaly, which, when palpated, elicits pain. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis?",

      "B": "Imatinib",
      "C": "Fludarabinern",
      "D": "Vincristinern"

  "model_response": "The patient’s history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry confirm the diagnosis. The treatment of choice for CLL is not curative but is aimed at palliation of symptoms and reduction of the leukemia cell count. The treatment of choice is fludarabine. Bleomycin is used in the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease. Imatinib is used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid used in the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",

This leads to a decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels and increase in uptake of LDL cholesterol. In addition, rosuvastatin, like other statins, exhibits pro-apoptotic, growth inhibitory, and pro-differentiation activities in a variety of tumor cell types; these antineoplastic activities may be due, in part, to inhibition of the isoprenylation of Ras and Rho GTPases and related signaling cascades."
