    "question": "A 40-year-old obese man presents to his primary care provider with a history of excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability. Upon further questioning, it is found that although his sleeping hours are adequate, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. His wife complains that he snores loudly all night. After ruling out common medical disorders and possible drug abuse, he is advised an overnight polysomnogram that records 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. Which of the following statements best describes this patient’s condition?",
    "options": {
      "A": "This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.",
      "B": "Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.",
      "C": "Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.",
      "D": "Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity."
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is 27.5 (12 + 30). Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction. Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
