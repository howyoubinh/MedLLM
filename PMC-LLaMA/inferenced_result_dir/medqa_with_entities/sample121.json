    "question": "A 40-year-old man presents to the physician with progressive weight loss for the last 3 months. He also says he frequently sweats profusely at night and has a recurring low-grade fever, for which he takes acetaminophen. The patient denies any symptoms like cough, breathlessness, or gastrointestinal symptoms. His temperature is 37.1ºC  (98.8ºF), pulse is 76/min, blood pressure is 116/78 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 13/min. On physical examination, he has generalized pallor. Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is present. Examination of his abdomen reveals non-tender hepatosplenomegaly in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory evaluation confirms the diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Which of the following viral infections is most likely to have played a role in the pathogenesis of this patient’s malignancy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Epstein-Barr virus",
      "B": "Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1",

  "model_response": "The patient has a classic presentation of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The Epstein-Barr virus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. The virus has a tropism for B cells and infects them by binding to CD21, the receptor for the C3d component of complement. The virus also has a tropism for the Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The virus establishes latent infections in B cells and may be reactivated later in life, with malignant transformation.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
