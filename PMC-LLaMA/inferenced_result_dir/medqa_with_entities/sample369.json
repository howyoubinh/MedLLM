    "question": "A 47-year-old female undergoes a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease. Post-operatively, she reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking. You suspect that this is likely a complication of her recent surgery. What is the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness?",
    "options": {
      "A": "1st pharyngeal arch",
      "B": "2nd pharyngeal arch",
      "C": "3rd pharyngeal arch",
      "D": "6th pharyngeal arch"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is a branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) and provides motor innervation to all of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, with the exception of the cricothyroid muscle. The recurrent laryngeal nerve passes into the larynx within the thyrohyoid membrane at the level of the inferior thyroid artery. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is a derivative of the 4th branchial arch and thus is a branch of the vagus nerve (CN X). The 1st pharyngeal arch gives rise to muscles of mastication and the malleus and incus of the middle ear. The 2nd pharyngeal arch gives rise to the stapes of the middle ear, the muscles of facial expression, and the stylohyoid and posterior belly of the digastric muscles. The 3rd pharyngeal arch gives rise to the stylopharyngeus muscle. The 6th pharyngeal arch gives rise to the cricothyroid muscle.}\n\nAnswer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
