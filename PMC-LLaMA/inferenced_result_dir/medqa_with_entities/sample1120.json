    "question": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician’s office with concerns about a recent pregnancy. She and her boyfriend had intercourse for the first time a few weeks ago. Two weeks ago she missed her menstrual period. She took several over the counter pregnancy tests that confirmed her pregnancy. She is tearful about the pregnancy and is very concerned. After extensive conversations with her physician and counseling, she decides she wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy. Which of the following drugs should be administered to this patient for this purpose?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tamoxifen",
      "B": "Terbutaline",
      "C": "Mifepristone",
      "D": "Copper intrauterine device"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The correct answer is Mifepristone. This medication is a progesterone receptor antagonist that is used for medical abortion. The medication is given orally and after 48 hours the patient takes Misoprostol which is a prostaglandin analogue. This medication is given orally or intravaginally and causes uterine contractions that aid in expulsion of the products of conception. Tamoxifen is a medication used in the treatment of breast cancer. It is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Terbutaline is a medication that is used for preterm labor. It is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist. The Copper T is an intrauterine device that is used for long-term reversible birth control. It is not used for medical abortion.\n\nAnswer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
