    "question": "A 29-year-old man is referred by his marriage counselor to the outpatient psychiatry clinic. The patient’s wife is with him and states that her husband is always complaining and critical of others. He was recently fired from his job to which he claims that his boss was jealous of his hard work. He also does not trust his neighbors and thinks they are out to get all the nice things he has. His wife also says that he has begun to doubt her fidelity and believes that even the marriage counselor is on her side. Which of the following psychiatric disorders also belongs to the same cluster of symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Schizotypal personality disorder",
      "B": "Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder",
      "C": "Antisocial personality disorder",
      "D": "Personality disorder not otherwise specified"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient’s symptoms are suggestive of paranoid personality disorder. Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by generalized mistrust and suspiciousness about the motives and actions of others and a tendency to interpret them as malevolent. The patient believes that: “Others are taking advantage of him.” “Others are not loyal to him.” “Others are envious of him.” “Others are lying to him.”\n\nSchizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentricities of behavior, appearance, and interpersonal relationships. Examples include odd beliefs or magical thinking, odd perceptual disturbances, and difficulties in sustaining long-term relationships.\n\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control. Patients may be stingy as well as stubborn and indecisive.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder is characterized by a disregard for and violation of the rights of the other and the rules of the society. It is characterized by repeated violations of the law and rules of the society (Drug abuse); Physical aggressiveness; Reckless disregard for safety of self or others; Consistent irresponsibility in work and family environment and lack of remorse.\n\nPersonality disorder not otherwise specified is a residual category for personality disorders that do not fit into any of the above categories.\n\nRef: Shelton R.C.
