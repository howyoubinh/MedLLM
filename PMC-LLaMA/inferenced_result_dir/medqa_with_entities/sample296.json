    "question": "A 52-year-old fisherman presents to the clinic for an evaluation of a pigmented lesion on his neck. He states that he first noticed the lesion last year, but he believes that it has been slowly growing in size. Dermatopathology determines that the lesion contains neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. Which of the following characteristics of the lesion would likely be found on physical examination?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area",
      "B": "Macule that is 5mm in diameter",
      "C": "Well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders",
      "D": "Itching and pain to palpation"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The lesion described is a lentigo maligna melanoma, which is most commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the body. The characteristic physical examination finding is a macule that is 5mm in diameter with irregular borders. The lesion may exhibit variegation of color with areas of brown-black pigmentation intermixed with red-white areas. These lesions are usually painless and non-pruritic.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
