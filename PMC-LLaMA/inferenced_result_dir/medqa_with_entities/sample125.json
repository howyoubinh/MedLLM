    "question": "A 33-year-old nurse is referred to an infectious disease specialist after she exhibited a PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration. She denies any cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, fevers, or night sweats over the last several months. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 120/81 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. An initial chest radiograph is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Isoniazid",
      "B": "No management indicated",
      "C": "Repeat PPD in 1 week",
      "D": "Rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a positive PPD skin test (> 10 mm of induration) but no symptoms or findings of active TB disease. Therefore, she is considered to have latent TB infection (LTBI). The most appropriate management of this patient is to administer a TB skin test to confirm the diagnosis of LTBI. If the follow-up test is positive, then treatment with isoniazid for 9 months should be initiated.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
