    "question": "A 60-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic hepatitis C infection comes to the emergency department because of abdominal distention and scleral icterus for the past month. His heart rate is 76/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F), and blood pressure is 110/86 mm Hg. Physical examination show signs suggestive of liver cirrhosis. Which of the following signs is a direct result of hyperestrinism in cirrhotic patients?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Coagulopathy",
      "B": "Gynecomastia",
      "C": "Jaundice",
      "D": "Caput medusae"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The presence of gynecomastia in male cirrhotics is due to the metabolic effects of estrogens, which are produced in increased amounts because of the liver disease. The hyperestrinism is due to the failure of the liver to metabolize estrogens and leads to an increase in the estrogen/androgen ratio. The other listed choices are not related to the hyperestrinism of cirrhosis. Coagulopathy is related to the decreased synthesis of clotting factors by the liver. Jaundice is due to the failure of the liver to metabolize bilirubin. Caput-medusae is related to the poal hypeension that develops as a consequence of cirrhosis.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
