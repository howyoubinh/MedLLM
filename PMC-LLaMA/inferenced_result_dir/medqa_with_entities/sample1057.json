    "question": "A 32-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of weight loss, night sweats, and productive cough. Auscultation of the lungs shows coarse crackles at the right upper posterior field. An x-ray of the chest shows an opacity in the right upper lobe. Sputum analysis shows acid-fast bacilli. A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands",
      "B": "Opsonization by complement proteins",
      "C": "Secretion of interleukin-4",
      "D": "Generation of reactive oxygen species"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The negative tuberculin skin test in this HIV-infected patient indicates a poor T-cell response to antigen. The interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands is required for full T-cell activation. Opsonization by complement proteins occurs in the classic pathway and is not required for T-cell activation. Interleukin-4 is required for the development of Th2 cells, which are involved in allergic and other immune responses, but not for T-cell activation. Generation of reactive oxygen species is a mechanism used by many cells to kill microorganisms. The absence of interleukin-12 would impair the development of a Th1 cell response, not a T-cell response.\n\nAnswer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
