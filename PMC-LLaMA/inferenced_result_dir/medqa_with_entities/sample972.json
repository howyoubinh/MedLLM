    "question": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks of gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient has attended many prenatal appointments and followed her physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. Her first child was delivered via normal vaginal delivery. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cervical examination shows 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation. A cardiotocograph is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amnioinfusion",
      "B": "Induced vaginal delivery",
      "C": "Reassurance",
      "D": "Repositioning"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This cardiotocograph shows variable decelerations. The decelerations are abrupt in decline and return to baseline, and they are not associated with uterine contractions. The initial step in management of this situation is repositioning the patient. The patient should be placed in a lateral decubitus position. If the pattern persists, then amnioinfusion with normal saline should be considered. Amnioinfusion with a dilute solution of uterine relaxant, such as ritodrine, can be used if the pattern persists despite repositioning and oxygen administration. If the pattern persists despite amnioinfusion, then immediate delivery is indicated.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
