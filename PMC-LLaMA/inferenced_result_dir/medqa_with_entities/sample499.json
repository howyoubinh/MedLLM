    "question": "A 30-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of infertility. He and his wife have been trying to get pregnant for the past two years. They have used fertility monitors and other aids without success. A hysterosalpingogram in his wife was normal. The patient has a history of cleft lip and recurrent upper respiratory infections as a child. He was briefly hospitalized for severe pneumonia when he was 9-years-old. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing male in no acute distress with fully developed reproductive organs. Notably, cardiac auscultation is silent in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This patient most likely has a mutation in which of the following classes of proteins?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Microtubule monomeric protein",
      "B": "Transmembrane ion channel protein",
      "C": "Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein",
      "D": "Anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient has a bicuspid aortic valve, which is a congenital heart defect. The most common genetic defect associated with bicuspid aortic valve is a mutation in the NOTCH1 gene, which encodes a transmembrane ion channel protein. The NOTCH1 gene is also associated with a higher risk of atherosclerosis. Microtubule monomeric proteins (choice A) are associated with cystic medial degeneration of the aorta, which is not a feature of bicuspid aortic valve. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene (choice C) are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Mutations in the kinesin motor protein (choice D) are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Mutations in the dynein motor protein (choice E) are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia.\n\n###Answer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
