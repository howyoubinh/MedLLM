    "question": "A 61-year-old man with schizophrenia in a locked inpatient psychiatry unit was observed making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits. Which of the following accurately describes his symptoms?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Tardive dyskinesia",
      "B": "Acute dystonia",
      "C": "Pseudoparkinsonism",
      "D": "Palsy"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "The patient is experiencing acute dystonia, which is a side effect of the haloperidol. It is most common in the first few weeks of treatment, but can occur at any time. It is more common in younger patients and patients who are receiving high doses of haloperidol. Acute dystonia can be treated with anticholinergic medications such as Benztropine, Promethazine, or Diphenhydramine. Tardive dyskinesia is a late-appearing side effect of antipsychotic medications, usually after several years of treatment. It is characterized by involuntary, repetitive, and purposeless movements of the tongue, lips, and extremities. Pseudoparkinsonism is a side effect of antipsychotic medications that mimics Parkinson's disease. It is characterized by rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. Parkinson's disease is not a side effect of antipsychotic medications.\n\nAnswer: OPTION B IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
