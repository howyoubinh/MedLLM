    "question": "An investigator is studying cellular regeneration of epithelial cells. She has obtained a tissue sample from a normal thyroid gland for histopathologic examination. It shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. Which of the following parts of the female reproductive tract is also lined by this type of epithelium?",

      "A": "Ovaries",
      "B": "Vagina",
      "C": "Fallopian tubes",

  "model_response": "The answer is B: Vagina. The histologic description is of the normal thyroid gland. The cells lining the follicles are called follicular cells or thyroid follicular epithelial cells. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vulva are lined by a variety of types of epithelia, none of which resemble the thyroid epithelium.\n\n###Deposition of colloid in the follicular cells is a sign of thyroid activity.\n\n###The thyroid gland is located anterior to the trachea at the level of the fourth to fifth tracheal rings.\n\n###The thyroid gland is composed of numerous follicles, which are small, spherical, colloid-filled structures lined by a single layer of epithelial cells.\n\n###The follicular cells are tall and columnar, with large, round, basophilic nuclei.\n\n###The follicular cells are arranged in a single layer around the colloid.\n\n###The colloid is composed of thyroglobulin, which is a large, globular protein.\n\n###The parathyroid glands are located on the posterior side of the thyroid gland.\n\n###The parathyroid glands are composed of chief cells, which produce parathyroid hormone, and oxyphil cells, which are not present in normal individuals but are seen in individuals with hyperparathyroidism.\n\n###The thyroid gland is the source of thyroid hormones, which are T3 and T4.\n\n###Thyroid hormones are synthesized by the follicular cells from the amino acid tyrosine.\n\n###Thyroid hormones are transported in the blood bound to thyroxine-binding globulin.\n\n###The thyroid gland is supplied by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries.\n\n###The thyroid gland is drained by the superior and inferior thyroid veins.\n###The superior thyroid vein drains into the internal jugular vein, and the inferior thyroid vein drains into the brachiocephalic vein.\n\n###The thyroid gland receives sympathetic innervation from the superior cervical ganglion.\n\n###The thyroid gland is located anterior to the trachea at the level of the fourth to fifth tracheal rings.\n\n###The thyroid gland is composed of numerous follicles, which are small, spherical, colloid-filled structures lined by a single layer of epithelial cells.\n\n###The follicular cells are tall and columnar, with large, round, basophilic nuclei.\n\n###The follicular cells are arranged in a single layer around the colloid.\n\n###The colloid is composed of thyroglobulin, which is a large, globular protein.\n\n###The parathyroid glands are located on the posterior side of the thyroid gland.\n\n###The parathyroid glands are composed of chief cells, which produce parathyroid hormone, and oxyphil cells, which are not present in normal individuals but are seen in individuals with hyperparathyroidism.\n\n###The thyroid gland is the source of thyroid hormones, which are T3 and T4.\n\n###Thyroid hormones are synthesized by the follicular cells from the amino acid tyrosine.\n\n###Thyroid hormones are transported in the blood bound to thyroxine-binding globulin.\n\n###The thyroid gland is supplied by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries.\n\n###The superior thyroid vein drains into the internal jugular vein, and the inferior thyroid vein drains into the brachiocephalic vein.\n\n###The thyroid gland receives sympathetic innervation from the superior cervical ganglion.\n\n###The answer is B: Vagina.
