    "question": "A 46-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with one week of intermittent nausea and vomiting. She does not have any sick contacts, and her medical history is significant only for diabetes well-controlled on metformin. She also complains of some weakness and back/leg pain. She says that she recently returned from traveling abroad and had been administered an antibiotic during her travels for an unknown infection. On presentation, her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 119/78 mmHg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 25/min. An EKG is obtained showing flattening of the T wave. After further testing, the physician prescribes a thiazide for this patient. Which of the following diseases is also associated with this patient's most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Rheumatoid arthritis",
      "B": "Sjogren syndrome",
      "C": "Systemic lupus erythematosus",
      "D": "Wilson disease"
    }
  },
  "model_response": "This patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to diabetic nephropathy. The intermittent symptoms of nausea and vomiting are consistent with uremia. The weakness and back/leg pain are likely due to hypocalcemia secondary to hyperphosphatemia. The EKG finding of flattening of the T wave is due to hypocalcemia. The thiazide prescribed by the physician will further exacerbate the hypocalcemia by decreasing the calcium concentration in the blood. The physician also prescribes a phosphate-binding agent, such as sevelamer, to decrease the serum phosphate concentration. The other diseases listed are not associated with diabetic nephropathy.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>",
