Patients with cholesterol embolization typically have acute onset of abdominal pain, fever, and altered mental status. The mottled purplish discoloration of the skin is a manifestation of small vessel occlusion. Renal papillary necrosis is a complication of diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by ischemic necrosis of the renal medulla, which results in sloughing of the papillae.

The blood smear shows many nucleated red blood cells, a finding that suggests a myelofibrotic process. The bone marrow shows extensive fibrosis with a few scattered plasma cells, also consistent with myelofibrosis. The JAK 2 mutation is present in most cases of myelofibrosis, and this is the likely diagnosis. The treatment of myelofibrosis is often palliative. The only curative therapy is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, but this is often not feasible in patients of this age. The therapy is often dictated by the symptoms. If the patient has anemia, then the first-line therapy is an androgen-like drug, such as hydroxyurea. If there is leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, then the first-line therapy is interferon. If the patient has marked thrombocytosis, then the first-line therapy is an antiplatelet drug, such as aspirin. If the patient has marked anemia, then the first-line therapy is an erythropoietin analogue. If the patient has marked leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, then the first-line therapy is a JAK 2 inhibitor, such as ruxolitinib. Cladribine is a drug used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia.

It is often improved by lying on the left side. The pain is usually pericardial in nature and not related to exertion. Radiation to the trapezius ridge is common. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a pericardial rub on physical examination or by the presence of pericardial effusion on echocardiography. The initial treatment of acute pericarditis is the same as that for unstable angina with aspirin 162-325 mg every 4-6 h and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as indomethacin 25-50 mg every 6 h.

The liver normally stores glycogen, which is converted to glucose and released into the bloodstream as glucose levels drop. Alcoholism can inhibit the liver's ability to store glycogen, leading to a constant state of hypoglycemia.\n\n###Answer: OPTION A IS CORRECT.</s><s><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk>"}

The respiratory burst is triggered by phagocytosis and involves a rapid increase in O2 consumption, which in turn leads to the production of superoxide (O2-) and H2O2. The superoxide is then conveed to H2O2 in the presence of myeloperoxidase. The H2O2 is able to kill bacteria and fungi by oxidizing cell components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The NBT test is used to assess the ability of neutrophils to undergo a respiratory burst. Patients with an inherited defect in the respiratory burst (such as chronic granulomatous disease) have neutrophils that are unable to undergo the oxidative burst and therefore cannot kill bacteria. These patients have an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. The other choices do not describe elements of the oxidative burst.Diagnosis: Chronic granulomatous disease\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s>"}

The mid- tarsal joint (talocalcaneal and calcaneocuboid) is a unique joint in that it is the only true synovial joint of the foot. The mid- tarsal joint is a functional unit that allows the foot to be flexible and adapt to changing terrain. The mid- tarsal joint is stabilized by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament, the medial and lateral collateral ligaments, and the tendons of the tibialis posterior and peroneus longus. The tarsometatarsal joint is a close-fitting ball-and-socket joint that allows very little motion. The tarsometatarsal joint is stabilized by the plantar and dorsal interosseous ligaments. The metatarsal joints are stabilized by the deep transverse metatarsal ligaments. The metatarsophalangeal joints are stabilized by the collateral ligaments and the plantar aponeurosis. The interphalangeal joints are stabilized by the collateral ligaments and the extensor and flexor tendon sheaths. Congenital clubfoot (equinovarus foot; talipes equinovarus) is a deformity of the foot in which the foot is plantarflexed, inverted, and adducted at the ankle joint (tibiotalar joint). The cause of clubfoot is not known. It is thought to be a combination of an inherent abnormality of the foot (primitive arches and digits) and positional deformity caused by abnormal intrauterine positioning. Clubfoot is usually seen in otherwise normal individuals. Clubfoot is more common in males and in children with myelodysplasia, arthrogryposis, and other disorders. The diagnosis of clubfoot is made by examination of the foot. The navicular and medial cuneiform bones are prominent, and the forefoot is deted medially. The heel is in equinus, and the Achilles tendon is very tight. The foot is supinated, and the 1st metatarsal is in adduction and supination. The treatment of clubfoot is individualized and depends on the severity of the deformity. Most patients are treated by the \"Ponseti technique\" of serial casting. Milder deformities can be treated by manipulation and taping. Severe deformities are treated by open surgery. The surgical treatment of clubfoot can be done by soft tissue release or by bony procedures such as triple arthrodesis.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>"}

The alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels are only mildly elevated, but the AST is significantly elevated, suggesting that the inflammation is relatively mild. The ultrasonographic findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with pancreatitis because the amylase level would be elevated. A fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine would result in much more severe symptoms. An infection with a hepatotropic virus would produce more constitutional symptoms and would not be localized to the gallbladder. Obstruction of the cystic duct would cause the gallbladder to become distended and would be associated with a much higher white blood cell count.\n\n###Answer: OPTION D IS CORRECT.</s><s><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk>"}

The most common joints affected by osteoarthritis are the cervical and lumbosacral spine, hip, knee, and first metatarsal phalangeal joint (MTP). The pain of OA is worse with activity and improves with rest. Morning stiffness, if present, is less than 1 hour. OA affects the joint surface and is associated with bone remodeling. The most common physical findings are joint line tenderness and bony enlargement of the DIP and PIP joints. OA is not associated with systemic symptoms such as fatigue, morning stiffness, or rash.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis is a seronegative inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis. The arthritis can precede the skin findings, and the two do not correlate. The DIP joints are commonly affected, and the arthritis can be erosive. Nail involvement, such as pitting, can be seen.\n\nArthritis mutilans is a rare, destructive form of psoriatic arthritis. The hands and feet are affected, and the pencil-in-cup deformity can be seen.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that commonly affects the hands and wrists. It is associated with morning stiffness, fatigue, and rash. Rheumatoid nodules can be seen in the extensor tendons of the hands and feet.\n\nMixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is an overlapping of clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and myositis. It is associated with Raynaud phenomenon, swollen hands, and anti-U1-RNP antibodies.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>"}

The underlying defect is a decrease in the number of Ach receptors at the neuromuscular junction caused by an antibody-mediated autoimmune attack. The disease predominantly affects women between the ages of 20 and 40. The initial symptoms are weakness of the extraocular muscles and ptosis. The disease eventually affects the limb muscles, and progressive weakness and atrophy occur. The diagnosis is confirmed by the edrophonium test. Administration of this drug briefly relieves the symptoms. Cholinesterase inhibitors may provide some improvement in symptoms, but the mainstay of therapy is thymectomy and immunosuppression.\n\nHypothyroidism (choice B) is associated with proximal muscle weakness. Myasthenia gravis (choice C) is associated with ocular and proximal muscle weakness. Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung (choice D) is associated with Lambert-Eaton syndrome, which is associated with proximal muscle weakness.

This is a disorder of B cell differentiation and maturation, characterized by normal or elevated levels of IgM and depressed levels of IgG and IgA. Patients with this disorder suffer from pyogenic infections, diarrhea, and chronic lung disease. The molecular basis of hyper-IgM syndrome has been identified in a number of patients. A variety of mutations and deletions that affect the CD40 ligand (CD40L) gene have been identified. CD40L is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family and is expressed on activated T cells. It interacts with CD40 on B cells and is critical for isotype switching. Patients with defective isotype switching do not produce isotype switched B cells (IgG and IgA), and hence have depressed levels of these antibodies. In contrast to patients with X-linked hyper-IgM, patients with a defect in CD40L have normal numbers of B cells.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk><unk>"}

Excess mucus production by goblet cells\nC. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells\nD. Proliferation of club cells\n\n### Response:\n\nThe normal alveolar lining contains two types of epithelial cells: type I pneumocytes, which are highly differentiated squamous cells that form the majority of the alveolar surface, and type II pneumocytes, which are cuboidal cells that secrete surfactant. In ARDS, the alveolar lining undergoes damage, and the repair process involves the proliferation of type II pneumocytes to reestablish the normal alveolar epithelial lining. Sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells is a normal process that occurs in healthy individuals. Excess mucus production by goblet cells is a feature of chronic bronchitis and asthma, not alveolar repair. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells is a feature of the fetal lung during development, not alveolar repair. Proliferation of club cells is a feature of the repair of the terminal bronchioles, not alveolar repair.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>"}
