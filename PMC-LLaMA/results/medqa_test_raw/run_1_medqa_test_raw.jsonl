Patients with cholesterol embolization typically have acute onset of abdominal pain, fever, and altered mental status. The mottled purplish discoloration of the skin is a manifestation of small vessel occlusion. Renal papillary necrosis is a complication of diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by ischemic necrosis of the renal medulla, which results in sloughing of the papillae. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that predominantly affects the lungs and kidneys.

This is a common occurrence in older men with generalized atherosclerosis. Renal artery stenosis (choice A) would be unlikely to cause this problem. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (choice B) would be unlikely to cause this problem. A common iliac artery aneurysm (choice C) could compress the ureter, but it is an uncommon condition. A urethral stricture (choice D) would be unlikely to cause this problem.

The patient was treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, which is an effective alternative to thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Aspirin is used in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes to prevent further thrombosis. Clopidogrel is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) antagonist that inhibits platelet aggregation. It is often used in addition to aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is used to treat hypertension and angina. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that is used to prevent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is used to treat hypertension and heart failure.\n\n###Answer: OPTION C IS CORRECT.</s><s>"}
